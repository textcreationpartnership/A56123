            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>In Commendation OF THE Enſuing Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>THE worthy Author of the enſuing Treatiſe I bleſs God that ever I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with, being fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the inward Uprightneſs and Sincerity of his Soul: beſides, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Reſolution and Courage, according to his Light, in following the Lord Jeſus in his deſpiſed way, and cleaving to his Truth and People, who are expoſed to the Scorn and Reproach of the World, and to many Profeſſors alſo, add to his high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Moreover, all that ſhall vouchſafe to read this Treatiſe, ſhall find that the bleſſed God hath graciouſly beſtowed no ſmall Light, Gifts and Knowledg upon him in the great Fundamentals of true Chriſtianity; the Lord certainly hath raiſed him up to defend his Truth and Intereſt in thoſe Northern Parts of this Kingdom where he dwells, in a more clear Light than many have attained: Beſides, he is not
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:34405:3"/>only furniſhed with Knowledg, but with a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Zeal, he being willing to work and labour in Chriſt's Vineyard. The Subject he hath wrote upon is ſuch, as calls (it is true) for the Pen of the moſt diſcerning Eye: many have wrote upon the two Covenants, but how clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and darkly is palpable to many; tho others have moſt excellently opened them, amongſt which the Reverend Mr. <hi>Nehemiah Cox</hi> in my Judgment hath exceeded; yet his Stile ſeems a little too high for ordinary Capacities. Our pious Friend, tho very conciſe, yet is very clear. As far as I can diſcern, 'tis evident that God made a twofold Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſet him up as a twofold Covenant-Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The one with his natural Seed as ſuch, in which Covenant he promiſed to <hi>be his God, and the God of all his natural Offspring</hi> that ſprang from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> upon the Condition of their anſwering the Terms thereof; which ſhews it was a meer Legal Covenant (or of the ſame nature with the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant:) and in this Covenant he ſeparated all his fleſhly Seed from all other People in the World to be his People, and viſible Church under that Diſpenſation, which conſiſted partly of the true ſpiritual Seed or Believers, and partly of Unbelievers: and in this Covenant he promiſed them the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and as a Sign or Token of all thoſe Legal Covenant-Bleſſings, he gave them the Rite of Circumciſion. Now this Church-ſtate was figurative or typical, and the Precepts and Ordinances were therefore typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and ſo continued till Chriſt came, and the Goſpel-Church (the Antitype of it) was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:34405:3"/>Many not ſeeing this, run into a great Error, thinking the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was but one entire Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace; whereas nothing is more clear than that Circumciſion belonged to all the Male Children that ſprang from <hi>Iſaac</hi> (tho their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were ungodly, or Unbelievers) as well as the Male Children of Believers that were of the ſame Seed. Beſides, if all the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh were in the Covenant of Grace, then one of theſe two things would follow, that they muſt all be ſaved, or elſe the Covenant of Grace is not a ſure, an everlaſting, or an unchangeable Covenant, nor of meer Grace, but a conditional Covenant, and ſo Men may fall from Grace, and periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Therefore in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, The Covenant of Grace which was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> 'tis evident was a diſtinct Covenant from the Covenant made with his fleſhly Seed as ſuch, and conſiſted only in an abſolute Promiſe of God's free Grace through Chriſt, which took in none but God's elect ones, and extended not only to the Elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, but thoſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 29. Moreover, it may ſeem ſtrange that ſome Pedo-baptiſts ſhould affirm, that every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parent is a like common Covenant-Head to all their Seed as <hi>Abraham</hi> was: for that was a Prerogative and Privilege only given to him; and if it is as they dream, then every believing Parent is the Father of all Nations, or of all Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, for ſo was <hi>Abraham</hi> made by the holy God.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:34405:4"/>See my late Replies to Mr. <hi>Burket</hi> Rector at <hi>Mildon;</hi> and to Mr. <hi>James Owen.</hi> I ſhall add no more, only let you know our Author ſeems directly to agree with us herein.</p>
            <p>As to our Author's Appendix, in which you have an account of his Experiences, and moſt pious Counſels to his Children, I am greatly affected therewith: the good Lord help not only his, but all the Children of Godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (to whoſe hands it ſhall come) to lay thoſe things to Heart. I wiſh from my Soul, that every Godly Family throughout this Nation had one of theſe Books: and that a Bleſſing may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, ſhall be the Prayer of him who is yet by Grace preſerved through many Trials to ſerve the Lord Jeſus in his Generation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſmall Ability,</p>

            <head>The EPISTLE to the Chriſtian READER.</head>
            <p>REader, in the peruſing of the Truths contained in this Book, I deſire thou mayſt, with the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> have recourſe to the holy Scriptures, which contain in them the Path that the Flock have walk'd in, who are gone before to the Manſions of eternal Reſt. The things laid down call for a more clear Diſcovery by ſome of God's Children, who are better fitted for ſo great a Work; and I do hope this may be as a Provocation to one of greater Ability to undertake it: All that I can ſay for my ſelf is, that what I have done was from an inward Conſtraint of Soul; through Grace I have been conſcious to my ſelf of my perſonal Weakneſs, and therefore I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have my Heart laid at the Feet of the bleſſed aſcended Jeſus, to whom I have devoted Soul and Body, and all that is dear unto me. My Soul hath endeavoured to keep ſight of my Lord by Faith held before me in the Goſpel-Glaſs, and to follow that borrowed Light which ſhines in the Saints from Chriſt the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Having in my youthful Years drunk in the Principles of Free-will, General Redemption, and falling away from Grace, which do fall in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:34405:5"/>with the Judgment of Man while he ſtands under the firſt Covenant; I was ſo ſettled in thoſe Opinions, that nothing leſs than an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power was able to draw my Mind to call the truth of them into queſtion. I was at times check'd by thoſe abſolute Promiſes laid down in the holy Scripture, which ſeem'd to ſecure to the Saints the certainty of perſevering and of enjoying Heaven at laſt; but was not able to reconcile them with other Scriptures, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings were annex'd together, and ſeem'd to ſtand upon terms with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But he who hath been pleaſed to reveal his Son in me, having brought me to ſee that the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> are diſtinguiſhed as ſtanding under the two Covenants of Works and Grace; and ſtanding in this different ſtate, the Scriptures ſpeak a Language which meets the Experience of each of them. I then with great pleaſure beheld the Harmony that was in the holy Scriptures; and having for many Years been trained in the School of the Covenant of Works, I have taken it in my way to clear it before I entred upon that well-ordered Covenant, by which all that are once enter'd into it are ſecured. I wiſh thou mayſt not be offended at the plainneſs of the Stile in which the Truths contained in this Book are laid down, and ſo I reſt a Lover of thy Soul,</p>

                  <p>AFter God had made the World, and all ſorts of living Creatures in it, he proceeds to make Man as the Perfection of this lower Region; conſiſting of two Parts, a comly Body, more beautiful than the reſt of the Creatures, not attended with the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and a rational Soul, fitted to hold
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34405:6"/>Communion with God, and to bear Rule over the reſt of the Creatures. From a ſight of the Creation, and of Man as the Lord of it, while he ſtood in his Obedience to his Creator, the Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> breaks forth into a holy Wonderment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>When I conſider the Heavens, the Work of thy Fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou haſt ordained; What is Man, that thou art mindful of him? and the Son of Man, that thou viſiteſt him? Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels, thou haſt crowned him with Glory and Honour: Thou madeſt him to have Dominion over the Works of thy Hands; thou haſt put all things under his feet.</hi> A cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Canopy over his Head, and a furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World for him to walk in, all Creatures giving a willing Subjection to him. And the great Creator, that he might ſhew unto Man the Authority that he had inveſted him withal, brings every Beaſt of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air unto <hi>Adam</hi> to receive its Name; <hi>and whatſoever</hi> Adam <hi>call'd every living Creature, that was the Name thereof.</hi> How great was the Happineſs of <hi>Adam</hi> while he ſtood in that ſtate in which he was created? He knew no wants in his Body, he had always a furniſhed Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the Earth affording him all the Varieties that Nature brings forth, and that without any Toil or Labour; he had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34405:6"/>a Garden, and that of God's planting, to walk in, and furniſhed with Trees bearing Fruit of every kind. What Gardener ſo skilful as the great Creator? and what Fruit ſo pleaſant as that which is of his own making? He not only planted the Trees, but cauſeth them by his own Power to bring forth, and ripens them to the height of Perfection: there were all ſorts of Fruits that were pleaſant to the ſight, and good for Food; a pleaſant River goes forth from this Garden to water it: And to add to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Happineſs, he is bleſt with the happy company of his Creator. Stop a little, my Soul, and take a view of <hi>Adam</hi> before Sin entered, and the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> when wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Sin, and clothed upon with their glorified Bodies. This beautiful <hi>Eden,</hi> or Earthly Paradiſe, is but a Type of the Heavenly Paradiſe; into this Paradiſe did the Tempter enter, into the Heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe he cannot come; this Happineſs was but ſhort, but that which is to come is eternal: In this God was enjoyed as Creator, in the other God will be enjoy'd as a Father, the Son as a Husband to us: <hi>Thy Maker will be thy Husband;</hi> the holy Spirit for ever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacling in thee, the holy Angels and glorified Saints thy Companions. O my Soul, is this the happy Country that thy Lord

                  <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his Goſpel, and the 2d, 3d, and 4th Verſes, ſpeaking of the ſecond Perſon in the Godhead, the eternal Word, ſaith, <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with God: All things were made by him; and without him was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made that was made. In him was Life, and that Life was the Light of Men:</hi> that is, That Divine Life which was in the eternal Word, Creator, did give forth the Beams of its Life and Light in making of the Soul of Man. Not that the Soul of Man did thereby become any part of the Godhead; to think this is no leſs than Blaſphemy, but an Image of God; <hi>Gen</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make Man in our own Image, after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34405:7"/>our Likeneſs: and let him have Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattel, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth. So God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he them.</hi> This Image of God did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the curious ſhape of his Body, altho the Beauty of it did far exceed the reſt of the Creatures; for this were to make God to conſiſt of Bodily Parts, and ſo confinable to one place, for a Body cannot be in two places as once; but this glorious Image con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the Faculties of the Soul, and the Impreſſions of the Law upon it. The Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul conſiſted of a ſpiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which God breathed into that frame of the Body to give it Life; it was not made of any earthly Matter, as was the Body, but of a ſpiritual nature like unto its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for altho it had not its being from Eternity, yet it was to continue to Eternity, and from the time of its Creation was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come under a Diſſolution; it was not made like the Soul or Life of Beaſts, of the ſame Matter whereof the Body was made, and therefore dieth with them, but was created by God immediately out of nothing; in which reſpect God is ſaid to be the Father of our Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Shall we not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34405:8"/>live?</hi> As it had Life in it ſelf when it was join'd to the Body, ſo it retaineth Life when it is ſeparated from the Body, and liveth for ever. It conſiſteth of theſe five Faculties; 1. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> wherein conſiſted true Wiſdom and heavenly Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. 2. The <hi>Memory,</hi> a holy remembrance of ſuch things as we ought. 3. The <hi>Will,</hi> a liberty of chooſing or refuſing. 4. The <hi>Affections,</hi> wherein lay the ſtrength of the deſire after God. 5. The <hi>Conſcience,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lay Man's Integrity or Uprightneſs in walking with God. And that the Soul might not be any ways deficient, the Impreſs of the Law of the Creator was ingraven upon it, which conſiſted in our Duty to God, and to one another. <hi>Adam</hi> wanted not Light to ſee the Excellency of the ſtate wherein he was created, which Light, if followed, would lead him to the Creator, as the Spring from whence this his immortal Soul did come. He was under the greateſt Obligations that were poſſible of loving his Creator, with all his Heart, with all his Mind, and with all his Strength, and his Neighbour as himſelf; both which parts of the Law he broke in going from his Duty to his Creator, and by offering Violence to all his Offspring, which were then in his Loins, he being made their Repreſentative, and the Root from whence they were all to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeed;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34405:8"/>which I ſhall treat of more at large in the next Chapter, and return now to ſpeak of the Excellency of the Soul, and of its immortal Nature; (1.) From the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; (2.) From Experience in our view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of dying Perſons. And, (3.) From the Sayings of many Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Scripture: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the Duſt return to the Earth; and the Spirit return to God who gave it.</hi> As it received Life from God without the Body, ſo being ſeparated from the Body it ceaſeth not to be, but goeth unto God its Creator, to be diſpoſed of by him; ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. I might alſo mention the Promiſe of Chriſt to the penitent <hi>Thief</hi> on the Croſs; <hi>I ſay to thee, This day thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;</hi> and that of the Parable of the rich Man and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> In our viewing of dying Perſons: How great Teſtimony have we of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Soul in its being immortal, in that when the Body is languiſhing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its laſt minutes, drawing to a Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Soul is more active and quick than ever, ſtriving as it were to be gone from it? Again, the Excellency of the Soul in the Immortality of it, doth appear in the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hopes of the Saints, and the dying Fears and Terrors of the Wicked: I my ſelf have ſeen ſome who in their dying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34405:9"/>hours have carried the greateſt Evidences of their Souls being immortal, and that they were going to the eternal Enjoyment of God that was poſſible to be given; enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the moſt daring Atheiſt; even a meeting of Death with the greateſt ſweetneſs and compoſedneſs of Spirit: <q>Give my Love, ſaith one to me, to ſuch and ſuch Friends, and tell them by ſuch a time my Soul will be in eternal Reſt.</q> Their Souls have given forth the greateſt Unconcernedneſs that was poſſible to part with thoſe things that had been moſt delightful unto them, by being brought to ſee into the Emptineſs of all theſe inferiour things, having received a view of the full Enjoyment of God to be had, and that their Souls when ſeparated from the Body, were capable of ſuch an enjoying of him. Not many Months ſince I my ſelf went to viſit a dying Friend, who at that time ſeem'd to me to be further from her Diſſolution than ſhe really was; ſhe ſeem'd to be exceeding chearful: I ſaid to her, <q>I hope you may recover, you are better than you have been: ſhe anſwered, I hope I ſhall not; to which I replied, Why do you hope ſo? She anſwer'd, My Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are clear for Heaven, and I long to have the Enjoyment of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again: What an Evidence doth the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fears of unconverted Sinners carry with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34405:9"/>it of the Excellency of the Soul, and of the Immortality of it? for altho that part of the Image of God in their Souls, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Duty to God, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be defac'd, and the Faculties of the Soul have loſt that Rectitude and Order in which they were created; yet the Evidences of the Excellency of it, in being immortal and capable of an eternal Enjoyment of God, have remained. What Concernedneſs hath filled the Souls of dying unconverted Sinners about their eternal loſs of God? and how have they been ſeiz'd with the ſad apprehenſions of an eternal excluſion from him? See Mr. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> on the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and Dr. <hi>More.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> A third Evidence of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and of the Excellency of it, doth appear from the words of many famous Gentiles, as quoted by <hi>William Penn</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> Chapter the 14th <hi>of Gentile Divinity of the Immortality of the Soul:</hi> To which might be added the Sayings of divers Heathen Writers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> The <hi>Soul is incorruptible, it never dieth; for when it goeth out of the Body, it goeth into the other World; the pure to God, the impure bound by Furies in indiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Chains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Heraclitus. <hi>If my Body be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, it may deſcend to the deſtinate place;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34405:10"/>nevertheleſs my Soul ſhall not deſcend, but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing immortal, ſhall fly up on high to Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> Socrates. <hi>The Body being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, it diſſolved by Death; the Soul being ſimple, paſſeth into another Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Corruption: The Souls of the good after Death are in a happy ſtate uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God in a bleſſed inacceſſible place, the bad in convenient places, ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment.</hi> The ſame <hi>Socrates</hi> being condemned to die by Poiſon, <hi>Crito,</hi> one of his Followers, ask'd him, <hi>How wilt thou be buried? As you think good</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if you can catch me, and if I give you not the ſlip.</hi> Then with a ſmile, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe that ſtood by him, <hi>I cannot perſwade</hi> Crito, ſaith he, <hi>that I am any more than the Carcaſe you will anon behold, and therefore he takes care for my Interment. It ſeems that what I even now told him, that as ſoon as I have taken the Poiſon I ſhall go to the Joys of the Bleſſed, hath been to little, purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid, it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Soul of Man is of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent frame or make. How happy was the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> while in the ſtate of Innocency, when every Faculty of the Soul ſtood in that Rectitude and Order wherein it was placed by the wiſe Creator, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34405:10"/>of what was required of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon his Heart? For if that Law which is call'd the Law of Nature, carry ſuch Beauty in it now, what Beauty had it in it before it was defac'd by Sin? <hi>Adam</hi> while in the ſtate of Innocency had no Corruption in him for to faſten the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon, his Will was free and at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to join with or refuſe the Temptation when preſented to him; and to incourage him in his Obedience, he had the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this his happy ſtate promiſed to him: for as the threatning if he diſobey'd God carried Death with it, ſo it muſt be implied that his Obedience ſhould continue Life to him. But ſtop, my Soul, and take a view of what thou haſt been treating in this Chapter: Was <hi>Adam</hi> ſo happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Soul created in the Image of God? Did his Underſtanding conſiſt in true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Was his Memory ſanctified with the remembring or meditating upon divine things? Was the Will at liberty of chuſing or refuſing? Were the Affections taken up with the deſire of enjoying Communion with the Creator? Was the Conſcience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in walking with God? Conſider, my Soul, that the Children of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who are gotten to the Souls of juſt Men made perfect in Glory, have this Image fully reſtored to them again; and in many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34405:11"/>reſpects are in a better condition than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> enjoy'd in Innocency; for his State was brought to the trial, whether he could be able to ſtand before a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or not; their Condition is eternally fixt, and never more ſubject to trial by any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. O my Soul, art thou intereſted by Faith in this ſecond <hi>Adam?</hi> Doſt thou wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a recovery of the ſame Excellency of the Image of God upon thee in a good meaſure, which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> enjoy'd in his Innocency by the powerful workings of the Spirit of God upon thee? Then wilt thou behold more and more of the Beauty of it; the more thou experienceſt of the recovery of this holy Image in thee, the ſtronger will be thy Cries after a full recovery of it: the more thou ſeeſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Corruption, by which this bleſſed Image is defac'd, the ſtronger will be thy Cries unto God againſt this Corruption, and that thou mayſt be brought to that bleſſed place where the Souls of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> are made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> The miſerable change of his Condition by the Fall; and how all his Offspring were included in it.</head>
                  <p>THE great and glorious Creator, that he might ſhew forth his Soveraignty over that curious Creature Man, whom he had created in his own Image, and that he might ſhew unto Man, that he did require a perfect Obedience from him was pleaſed to try his Obedience by prohibiting of him to eat of the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil; — <hi>for in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> This Tree was to be as a warning to them of their Mutability; for altho the ſtate wherein they were created was a moſt glorious ſtate, nevertheleſs it was ſuch a ſtate as was liable to be loſt; the Creature enjoying of it upon the terms of a perfect Obedience; not that the Tree could give Knowledg, but by taſting of if, the terms upon which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſtood in the favour of God, were broken on Man's part, and ſo they came to have the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledg of Evil in themſelves,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34405:12"/>which before they had of Good only. But altho God had no hand at all in Satan's Temptation, or in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s Sin, yet we may ſafely own God to be concerned in the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to far as to give them up into the hands of the Tempter, and giving the Tempter power over them, to try them whether they would willingly go from their Obedience to God or no; he having afore by his eternal Decree deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to magnify his Power, Juſtice and Mercy: For being able to bring Good out Evil, as Light out of Darkneſs, he ordereth in his Wiſdom the Fall of Man, to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Glory of his Mercy in thoſe that ſhall be ſaved in Chriſt, and of his Juſtice on thoſe that ſhall periſh for their Sins out of Chriſt. Satan being fallen from a glorious Angel through his Pride into the depths of Ruin, was fill'd with Melice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and with Envy at the happy ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and endeavours to bring them into the like Miſery with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſo is rightly call'd a Murderer from the beginning: Joh. 8.44. <hi>He was a Murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the Truth, becauſe there is no Truth in him: When he ſpeaketh a Lie, he ſpeaketh of his own, for he is a Liar, and the Father of it.</hi> He gains upon <hi>Eve,</hi> by firſt queſtioning her concerning what God had commanded,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34405:12"/>
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of Every Tree of the Garden?</hi> And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her Anſwer that he gain'd upon her, ſhe not anſwering to his Queſtion, as God had ſpoken, that ſurely they ſhould die, but by a term of doubting, <hi>leſt ye die;</hi> he proceeds in his Temptation to a flat denial of the truth of the Threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>And the Serpent ſaid unto the Woman, Ye ſhall not ſurely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, your Eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> Hereby endeavouring to beget in <hi>Eve</hi>'s Mind hard thoughts of God; as if his prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting them to eat of that Tree, was to keep a future good from them; and begetting Pride in her Mind, in not being ſatisfied with that happy ſtate and condition that ſhe was then in.</p>
                  <p>Thus through Unbelief in God, and Pride to be like unto God, did Sin enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eve;</hi> and through <hi>Eve</hi>'s Prevalency with her Husband, Sin enter'd into him. Thus we may ſee the nature of Sinners is to draw others to the ſame Condemnation they are in, as Satan <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> her Husband, even thoſe who are neareſt them, whoſe good they ſhould procure.</p>
                  <p>Having cleared up how <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were brought into their fallen State, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew the miſerable ſtate that they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34405:13"/>were fallen into, and how their Offſpring were included in it, and I ſhall treat of it under theſe three Heads: I ſhall, firſt, ſhew the miſerable change that was brought upon their Souls. Secondly, The miſerable change that was brought upon their Bodies. And, Thirdly, The miſerable ſtate they brought upon all their Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>The Sentence threaten'd againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> for their Diſobedience in eating the forbidden Fruit, did not reach to a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Soul as to its being; for the Soul remains immortal after Sin enter'd as it was before; but the Sentence reached to a Diſſolution of that Union that was betwixt the great Creator and the Soul: the Soul by Sin being changed from that happy ſtate in which it was created, into a ſtate of Miſery, the Faculties of the Soul being put out of that Rectitude and Order in which at firſt they were placed.</p>
                  <p>The Understanding, wherein conſiſted true Wiſdom, and the knowledg of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, is now become blind and dark, ignorant of God, and of his Will; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>But the natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17, 18, 19. <hi>This I ſay therefore, and teſtify in the Lord, that ye
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34405:13"/>henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their Minds; having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkened, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their Hearts: who being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over unto Laſciviouſneſs, to work all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Underſtanding is ſo far from being taken up with the Knowledg of God, his Mind and Will, that it labours more and more after the knowledg of the ways of Sin, and ſo becomes more and more eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from God; wiſe to do evil, but to do good without Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The Memory, wherein lay a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of heavenly things, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dull and forgetful, and eaſily lets go thoſe things which we are in the chiefeſt place concerned to remember: we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member readily the things which concern this Life; the Vanities and Follies of the ways of Sin. What deep Impreſſion do theſe things make upon the Memory of poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? But things which lead to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and the everlaſting Welfare of the immortal Soul, how ſlippery and weak is the Memory become to retain theſe?</p>
                  <p>The Will, wherein lay the liberty of chooſing or refuſing, and before Sin enter'd,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34405:14"/>will'd always that which was good, is now become impotent and weak in its joining with Good; how is it inſlaved by Sin, and in the Chains of Satan? Rom. 6.20. <hi>For when you were the Servants of Sin, ye were free from Righteouſneſs.</hi> Holineſs, without which God cannot be enjoy'd, the poor uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinner hath no Will in him to lay hold of; but on the contrary, luſteth after that which is evil. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>And God ſaw that the Wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of his Heart was evil continually:</hi> compared with <hi>Job</hi> 15.16. <hi>How much more abominable is Man, who drinketh Iniquity like Water?</hi> Yea, what an Enmity is ſeated in the Will of unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sinners againſt the ways of Holineſs? How do their very Hearts riſe againſt it? Rom. 8.7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Affections of the Soul, wherein lay the ſtrength of the deſire after God, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Sin. How are they ſet upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet Objects? inclined to things they ſhould not be, and not to thoſe they ſhould? Thus we naturally hate good, and love evil. 1 Kings 22.8. <hi>And the King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>There is yet one Man</hi> (Micaiah <hi>the Son of</hi> Imlah) <hi>by whom we may inquire of the Lord: but I hate him, for he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34405:14"/>doth not propheſy good concerning me, but evil.</hi> Our Affections are naturally raiſed to meet Sin, and the Temptations that lead into it; and do even embrace the Temptation; but are not ſtirred up to that which is Good, unleſs it be to eſchew and ſhun it: Beſides, when the Affections do move, how diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is their Motion? when merry, too mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when ſad, too ſad.</p>
                  <p>The Conſcience, wherein lay Man's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, or walking with God, and wherein were the Impreſſions of the Divine Law, which contained in it our Duty to God, and to one another, how is it diſordered by Sin? the Acts of Sin taking away the inward ſenſe and feeling of the evil of it. And with what weakneſs doth that firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Light, which leads the Soul to ſeek after God as Creator, move in the Soul? How are its Reproofs hardly taken notice of by moſt Perſons, and that, by reaſon of that great Darkneſs that is fallen upon the Soul of Man?</p>
                  <p>Thus we may ſee that Sin, as a Leproſy, hath over-run all the Faculties, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a Body in the Soul, conſiſting of many Members, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. <hi>But I ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. O wretched Man that I am! who ſhall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34405:15"/>deliver me from the body of this Death?</hi> Tho all Sin doth not appear alike in all, ſome by Nature are more mild and courteous than others; the reaſon of which difference is not, that there are not the ſame ſeeds of Corruption in all, but that the Lord keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down thoſe Sins in ſome, which he ſuffereth to riſe up in others.</p>
                  <p>The Children of God, that are by the Inlightnings of the holy Spirit come to ſee into the Corruptions of their Hearts, how do they ſee the ſeeds of Sin lying in their Souls, even of ſuch Sins which they thought had not been in them? The Heart or Soul doth then appear to be deſperately wicked: who but God himſelf can have the full knowledg of it? For the Children of God in their ſearches after Heart-corruptions, cannot come to find the bottom of them: ſo far is the Soul of Man fallen from God by Sin, that it is afraid to come nigh unto God; it flies farther and farther from God, until it gets into the Pit of eternal Miſery. How dark was <hi>Adam</hi> become by Sin, as to think the Trees of the Garden could hide him from the Eye of the great Creator? And that God might aggravate and heighten his Sin, he ſpeaks ironically, by way of taunt, <hi>The Man is become like one of us:</hi> He is come to know Evil by woful experience, he is fill'd with inward Horror, and with outward Shame.</p>
                  <p>

Secondly, I ſhall ſhew the miſerable ſtate that <hi>Adam</hi> was brought into by the Fall as to his Body; for no ſooner was he fallen, but the Sentence was inflicted on him, <hi>That in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> Altho the Sentence was not ſo far put in execution againſt him, as to ſeparate the Soul from the Body, yet his bodily ſtate was ſo far changed, as to bring it under thoſe Evils that lead to a Diſſolution. He was driven out of that pleaſant Garden of Delight in which God at firſt placed him, into the Earth, to get his Living in it amongſt the Beaſts of the field: and whereas in his innocent ſtate he had a furniſhed Table pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided without labor or toil, God himſelf having by his own Power provided things neceſſary for his bodily Subſiſtence; now he muſt till the Earth with labour and toil, which was put under the Curſe of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Man's ſake, until the poor Body wearied out, returneth to the Earth, by a painful Death, from whence it was taken; <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> The Beaſts of the Field who gave a willing Subjection to him as their Soveraign, were now ſo far eſtranged from him, as to rebel againſt him, and ready to put in execution the Sentence of a bodily Death: the Air in which he breathed, was changed for his ſake, and infected the poor Body with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34405:16"/>ſorts of Diſtempers, Sores, Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes of all ſorts; Sin being the cauſe of all this Miſery. Mat. 9.2. <hi>And behold, they brought to him a Man ſick of the Palſie, lying on a Bed: and Jeſus ſeeing their Faith, ſaid unto the ſick of the Palſie; Son, be of good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</hi> Thus by taking away the Sin, he takes away that which was inflicted upon the poor Body for it: Beſides all this Miſery that is inflicted upon the poor Body in this Life, if it be not brought within the compaſs of a ſhare in the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at the morning of the Reſurrection it muſt be reunited to the Soul, and ſentenc'd to ſhare with the Soul in eternal Miſery, having been a ſharer with it in a courſe of Sin in this Life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew the Miſery that <hi>Adam</hi> brought upon all his Offspring by the Fall. <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood not before God as a ſingle Perſon, but as one that had all his Offspring in him. They being all in him, and to proceed from him by Generation, became ſharers with him in that ſtate which he fell into; Gen. 5.3. <hi>And</hi> Adam <hi>lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a Son in his own Likeneſs, after his Image, and called his Name</hi> Seth; born to the ſame Miſery that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> was in, and a ſharer with him in it. <hi>Adam</hi> received Light from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34405:16"/>Creator, and a holy rectitude of Soul; and was under no neceſſity of giving way to a Temptation, there being nothing in him, while in his ſtate of Innocency, to faſten a Temptation upon; ſo that his Fall was a voluntary going off from God. He receiving thoſe excellent Endowments of Soul and Body as a publick Perſon, by his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion <hi>Judgment came upon all Men to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi> Rom. 5.14. <hi>Nevertheleſs Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them who had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſgreſſion.</hi> For from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> we do not read that after the Fall God ever treated with <hi>Adam,</hi> or with his Offspring, by an outward trial upon the terms of <hi>Do and live.</hi> Beſides, Death then reigned, and doth ſtill reign over little Children, whoſe Infant-ſtate makes them uncapable of being put to the trial of their Obedience. How doth daily Experience ſhew us that poor Infants are many times arreſted, as ſoon as gotten into the World, by grievous Diſtempers, as the Convulſions, and ſuch like, which keep them in grievous Miſery for ſeveral days together before the Soul be ſeparated from the Body? which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Teſtimony that they have another's Sin imputed to them, by which their very Nature is defiled; upon which defiled Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Death feeds, until it hath brought it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34405:17"/>to Diſſolution as to their Bodies; but their Souls I deſire to leave to that rich and free Grace which flows to Sinners through a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Spirit's applying of it to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any outward means.</p>
                  <p>Having gone through this third Chapter, which contains the miſery of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his Offspring, before thou leaveſt it, make ſome Application of it to thy own Soul. Look back, my Soul, and ſee what thou waſt in an unconverted ſtate; thou ſpentſt twelve Years in groſs darkneſs, without the leaſt knowledg of that God from whence thou receivedſt thy being: thou waſt wholly given up to the ways of Sin, without the leaſt conſideration what bitter Fruit it did produce; that the way of it led to the Chambers of Death, and the Pit of eternal Miſery. How many times waſt thou, while in this ſtate, nigh the Diſſolution of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the Grave, both to thy ſelf and others, ſeeming to open its Mouth to receive thee? What could have been thy ſtate in eternity, if thou hadſt been then removed? Dos not the holy Scripture fully declare that thoſe who ſpend their days in Sin, and in Satan's ſlavery, ſhall he eternally miſerable with him? O my Soul, tho thou couldſt not pity thy ſelf, becauſe of that groſs darkneſs that was upon thee; yet that God that gave
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34405:17"/>thee thy being pitied thee, and extended ſparing Mercy to thee.</p>
                  <p>It is he that hath delivered thy Soul from Death, thine Eyes from Tears, and thy Feet from falling. Thou now groaneſt in an unredeemed Body; but thou viewſt by Faith a redeem'd one. Doth the Creation groan by reaſon of that weight of Sin that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? Thy Lord Jeſus's Return draws very nigh; his Coming will bring with it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Curſe; and times of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall come with him; he will renew the Earth, and in it ſhall dwell nothing but Righteouſneſs.</p>

The nature of the leadings of that firſt Covenant-light; and the Condition of thoſe that ſtand under the higheſt Attainment of it.</head>
                  <p>THat <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick Perſon, and that the great Creator enter'd into Covenant with him upon the terms of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34405:18"/>
                     <hi>Obey and live,</hi> hath been proved in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, and ſhall by the help of the Spirit of God be more fully demonſtrated in this. That all his Offspring, as deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him by Generation, are under the ſame Covenant, have ſome remaining Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the ſame Law upon their Souls, and Light from the Creator anſwering the terms of that firſt Covenant, I ſhall Firſt clear up from Scripture; Secondly, from the Sayings of many famous Gentiles; Thirdly, from common Experience of all Perſons that do take notice of the dealings of God with their Souls.</p>
                  <p>And, Firſt, to prove it from Scripture; Deut. 30.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>For this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off: it is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou mayeſt do it. I have ſet before thee this day Life and Good, and Death and Evil.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law; theſe having not the Law</hi> (that is,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34405:18"/>in the outward letter) <hi>are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> From which Scriptures it is evident, that the Law delivered at <hi>Sinai,</hi> and written in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone, was but a Copy of this inward Law which was ingraven in the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> and on the Souls of all his Offspring.</p>
                  <p>It doth further appear, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offspring as they deſcend from him, are under the ſame Covenant with himſelf, from their dealing with God, and his with them, according to the terms of that firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Gen. 4.5, 6, 7. <hi>But unto</hi> Cain <hi>and his Offering he had not reſpect; and</hi> Cain <hi>was very wroth, and his Countenance fell: and the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Cain, <hi>Why art thou wroth? and why is thy Conntenance fallen? If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doeſt not well, Sin lieth at the door. Cain</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Offering, as a fruit of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to his Creator, and expected accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon the account of his Obedience; which proving otherwiſe than he hoped, he was wroth, and his Countenance fell: the Lord gives him the reaſon why his Offering was not accepted, becauſe it was imperfect; the worthineſs of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering lying in an act of Faith
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34405:19"/>put forth in a Redeemer to come, upon whoſe worthineſs he grounded the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, and not upon the terms of the firſt Covenant; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 12.2. Another Scripture which I ſhall mention is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28. <hi>Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might work the works of God?</hi> From whence it is clear, that notwithſtanding the outward means they enjoy'd, which were to lead them as Sinners to a Redeemer, they ſtill remain under the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, to ſhew that the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> have the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light which leads to the Creator, that <hi>Adam</hi> enjoy'd. Prov. 20.27. <hi>The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the Belly.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. <hi>For the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs: Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them. For the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead; ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> By the Spirit of Man he intends the Soul of Man, that is indued with ſuch excellent Qualities, which, if improved to their right
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34405:19"/>end, do lead the Creature into the Duties required in the firſt Covenant; and by viewing the Works of Creation, to that eternal Power and Godhead, by which all things were created: the not improving of which Light leaves them without excuſe before God, as they ſtand under the firſt Covenant. Theſe Gentiles, of which the Apoſtle is treating, did darken that Light which led them to view the Godhead in the works of Creation, by their Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is, Impiety, Profaneneſs, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition that they run into; ſo that God gave them up to ſtrong Deluſions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; I ſhall prove that all the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring deſcending from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are under the ſame Covenant with him, have ſome remaining Impreſſions of the ſame Law upon their Souls, and Light from the Creator leading to anſwer the terms of the firſt Covenant, from the Sayings of many famous Gentiles.</p>

                     <q>God grant, ſaith he, that I may always be ſo happy as to obſerve that venerable Sanctity in my Words and Deeds which is commanded by theſe noble Laws (ſpeaking of the Laws writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Mens Conſciences) which were made in Heaven.

To live (ſaith he) according to this Knowledg and Direction, is truly to live according to Vertue, not doing any thing that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: The Vertue and Happineſs of a Man depends upon a cloſe Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34405:20"/>of his Mind with the Divine Will of him who governeth the Univerſe. Again, ſaith the ſame <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> the Knowledg of God is imprinted upon the Minds of Men.</q>

                     <hi>Plutarch,</hi> ſpeaking of the Principle of God in the Conſcience, ſaith, <q>It is a Law not written in Tables or Books, but dwelling in the Mind always, as a living Rule, which never permits the Soul to be deſtitute of an inward Guide. Again, ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi> to debaſe this antient Faith of Mankind and natural Belief, which is planted in all reaſonable Souls, is to overthrow the ſtrong and everlaſting Foundation of Vertue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude theſe Sayings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles with <hi>Antiſtheties; William Penn</hi>'s Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Divinity, Chriſtian Quaker, <hi>pag.</hi> 72. <q>He was Inſtitutor of the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> as they were call'd, and Scholar to <hi>Socrates;</hi> he taught that Vertue was the trueſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that Piety was alone needful to a laſting Happineſs; that true Vertue ſtood not in ſaying, but doing that which was good; not in much Learning, or many words, but upright Actions. In ſhort, that the Principle of Vertue is ſufficient to what Wiſdom is needful, and that all other things ought to have reference thereto; that Piety is the beſt Armor,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34405:21"/>and vertuous Perſons are always Friends; that Vertue is an Armour none can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pierce or take from good Men. He prefers a juſt Man before his Neighbour; and good Womens Souls have the ſame Privilege to Vertue with Mens. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Pleaſure one of the greateſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs in the World: and being ask'd what Learning was beſt? he anſwers, that which unlearns Men Evil; for thoſe who would live for ever, muſt have a care that their Lives be holy and juſt in this World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; I ſhall prove that all the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> deſcending from him, are under the ſame Covenant with him, have ſome remaining Impreſſions of the ſame Law upon their Souls; and Light from the Creator, leading to anſwer the terms of the firſt Covenant, from the common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all Perſons that take notice of the dealings of God with their Souls. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a ſinful Peace gain'd by Perſons in a zealous performance of an outward Worſhip, handed down unto them by their Anceſtors, and that Peace which Perſons gain by the Conduct of that Light which leads to God upon the terms of the firſt Covenant. That the firſt moving or ſtirring of the Soul is by this firſt Covenant-light doth appear, in that the Work upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34405:21"/>the Heart doth uſually begin with a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſome Sin or Sins committed againſt one of the two Tables of the Law; either that which contains our Duty to God, or to our Neighbour: which inward diſcovery of Sin hath attending of it Guilt and Fear of either ſome temporal or eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the eſcaping of which Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Soul doth betake it ſelf to a cloſe adherence to this inward Light; and by following of it, and giving attendance to it, the Impreſſions of the Law, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains our Duty to God, and to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (which is ingraven upon the Souls of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offspring) comes to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us, and we are led to follow the Rule of this inward Law. And by giving Obedience to it Peace is gain'd, and by keeping in our Obedience Peace is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; the Light giving the Soul no further diſturbance, than as it becomes guilty of the breach of this inward Law: which the Gentiles on the other ſide, and every moral Perſon with them coming to witneſs, makes them preſs after it more and more, by which they come to ſhine forth before Men by a ſober Converſation. That this Light is a diſtinct thing from the Work of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Souls of the Saints is evident, becauſe all its dealings with God are as Creator, and upon the firſt Covenant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34405:22"/>terms, that is, <hi>obey and live.</hi> In its Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lies its Hope, upon its Obedience is its enjoyment of God here bottom'd, and the eternal enjoyment of God in Glory; to theſe the <hi>Reward is not of Grace, but of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4. By Reward is meant eternal Life; they are not brought to ſee the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectneſs of their Works, that ſo as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they may come to Chriſt, and through him to God, to receive a Pardon upon Grace's account, from a ſenſibility of Soul that they have a real need of it. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were yet brought out of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but only ſtand as Witneſſes of it, and for God in it under high Attainments. Their everlaſting State we are to leave to him who is appointed to be the Judg of all Men: only before I leave them, or end this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall ſhew by the holy Scriptures how their State differs from the State of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The Light by which theſe Perſons are led, is by <hi>Will. Penn</hi> call'd the Light of Chriſt; and that it is ſufficient, if followed, to lead to eternal Salvation. And indeed if his Chriſt which he deſcribes unto us were the true Chriſt, then the Gentiles on the other ſide, and every moral Perſon were brought to the enjoyment of him; but his words being brought to the Rule of the holy Scriptures, and tried by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Saints, he is found to be a poor deceived Perſon.</p>

                     <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Chriſtian Quaker, <hi>p.</hi> 96, 97. <q>And this is unqueſtionably confirm'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by that known and very weighty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning the Fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Amen. Since here both Chriſt is diſtinguiſhed from the Body he took and made one with that God, <hi>who is over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi> Amen. As much as to ſay, of whoſe Fleſh Chriſt took; therefore Chriſt was before he took it, or his taking it did not conſtitute him Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to <hi>William Penn:</hi> If the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood united to the eternal Word, Creator, did not go to conſtitute him Chriſt, then theſe Gentiles of which he treats were Chriſtians, for they were all led to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of God as Creator. But herein he abuſes the Apoſtles words, and contradicts the Faith of Chriſtians in all Ages: the Apoſtle is ſhewing us, that he who was held forth in the Promiſes to be the Lord's Chriſt, was to take his Fleſh or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Fathers; that is, according to the Promiſes, he was to be of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and <hi>David</hi>'s Son; and yet as to his Divine Nature, was from everlaſting God bleſſed for ever: The Apoſtle is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his two Natures in this Scripture,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34405:23"/>
                     <hi>William Penn</hi> is endeavouring to throw away his Manhood. Beſides, by the ſame way of arguing, may his Godhead be removed from conſtituting him Chriſt; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Therefore let all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> The holy Scripture is ſometimes giving the name Chriſt to him as he was God; in other places it gives the name Chriſt to him as Man, that ſo we might have his two Natures diſtinguiſhed to us, not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be ſeparated. And mark it, Chriſtian Reader, that altho the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtood in the Decree of God, as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in one Perſon, to appear in the fulneſs of time, and was ſo held forth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the Fathers in the Old Teſtament; yet thoſe Promiſes were ſubſervient to his Appearance in the ſtate of his Humiliation in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and pointed at it; and ſo were the Fathers by the Light of Holy Ghoſt inabled to behold him, and lay hold of him as their Saviour, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 11th Chapter, and 12th, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in the Power of it is a relinquiſhing the firſt Covenant-Principles of Light in the Creator, and <hi>do and live,</hi> as the Condition of eternal Life, for the Light of Faith in the eternal Word made Fleſh (or join'd to Man's Nature) <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>But as many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34405:23"/>as received him, to them gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his Name.</hi> The Childrens admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Preſence of God is upon the account of a Redeemer, upon the account of a Mediator held forth outwardly in the Scriptures, apprehended inwardly by Faith through the help of the holy Spirit: the Children go without Works when they go to Chriſt, and through him to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>IN clearing up the weighty Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this Chapter, I ſhall treat of it under theſe three Heads: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Set forth the Soveraignty of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew that Election proceeds from him as an Act of Grace and Goodneſs; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of his own Glory being that which is carried on in the Decree of Election.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34405:24"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew how the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Head of the Elect, and made the way through which electing Love doth paſs to every elect Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſet forth the Soveraignty of God from the holy Scriptures; <hi>Iſa</hi> 40.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Who hath meaſured the Waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out Heaven with a Span, and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a meaſure, and weighed the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance? Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counſeller hath taught him? With whom took he Counſel, and who inſtructed him, and taught him in the Path of Judgment, and taught him Knowledg, and ſhew'd him the way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding? Behold, the Nations are as a drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the ſmall Duſt of the Balance: Behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing.</hi> The Majeſty and the infinite Power that is in God, when ſome glimmering of it is beheld by the Soul, how doth it lay it in the Duſt before him, and make it willing to be reſigned up unto him, to be diſpoſed of by him. For as his own Pleaſure and his own Glory was the moving Cauſe why he created Angels and Men; ſo in diſpoſing of them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own good Pleaſure, who ſhall ſay to the moſt High, Why doſt thou thus? God will be honoured by all his Creatures
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34405:25"/>in a way of Mercy, or in a way of Juſtice. That he ſecured part of the Angels in the ſtate wherein he created them, is infinite Grace to them; that he gave up others that fell from him to follow the Counſel of their own Wills, and to perſiſt in a courſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him, that ſo they might glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the Attribute of his Juſtice, is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in him; the Evil which they brought upon themſelves being a voluntary Act of their own. That part of the Offspring of <hi>Adam</hi> are reſcued out of their fallen ſtate by rich and free Grace, whilſt the reſt are left to the Light or Law of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, under which the great Creator hath placed them, determining to proceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them according to the Tenor of that Covenant which they ſtand under before him, is his own good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>In clearing up the Soveraignty of God I ſhall proceed a little further, and before I leave it open two or three Scriptures in <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 2.3. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Haſt thou conſidered my Servant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright Man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth Evil? and ſtill he holdeth faſt his Integrity, altho thou movedſt me againſt him, to deſtroy him</hi> (that is, in his outward Eſtate) <hi>without cauſe.</hi> From hence I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Sin was not the moving cauſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34405:25"/>why that great outward Calamity fell upon <hi>Job,</hi> but an Act of God's Soveraignty over his Creature, intending to bring Glory to himſelf out of the Miſery of his Servant, of whom he might diſpoſe as he pleaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Injuſtice. And <hi>Job</hi> beholding God dealing with him in a way of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, his Soul was kept in a right frame before him; <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Then ſaid his Wife unto him, Doſt thou ſtill retain thy Integrity? Curſe God, and die. But he ſaid unto her, Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh Women: Shall we receive Good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive Evil?</hi> The beſt Support for God's Children when under Affliction, is to look at the Soveraignty of God, that ſo they may be kept from murmuring againſt him. When we look up unto God, as no ways bound to us, but as he is pleaſed himſelf, it makes us ſtoop before him; and when the Soul goeth from its Duty here, it goeth from that which ſhould ſupport it in Peace and Quietneſs. An Example we have in <hi>Job,</hi> when he begun to ſtand upon terms with God, how was his Spirit unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled? as <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1 to the 35th, and then he breaks forth, <hi>O that one would hear me! Behold, my deſire is, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would anſwer me.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>I would declare unto him the number of my ſteps, as a Prince would I go near unto him.</hi> Look
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34405:26"/>forward into <hi>Job</hi> 40. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1 to 15. and we find that God doth come forth to anſwer <hi>Job;</hi> but how doth he anſwer him? Doth he give <hi>Job</hi> an account why he brought ſuch Calamity upon him? No, he ſtands upon his Soveraignty, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Shall he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth with the Almighty, inſtruct him? He that reproveth God, let him anſwer it.</hi> Doth <hi>Job</hi> now make good what he ſaid, that he would declare unto him the number of his ſteps? as a Prince doth he go nigh unto him? No, he falls under him, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</hi> Here is the end of the Creatures ſtanding upon terms with God, and here is the ſafety of God's Children to endeavour to witneſs a humble ſubmiſſive frame of Spirit to him.</p>
                  <p>I have treated hitherto of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God: I come now under the ſecond Head, to ſhew, that Election pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from God as an Act of Grace and Goodneſs; the advancing of his own Glory being that which is carried on in the Decree of Election; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>And that he might make known the Riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory.</hi> For altho God was infinitely happy in himſelf, yet ſo great is his condeſcending Grace to thoſe whom he doth by his eternal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34405:26"/>Decree chooſe to be Veſſels of Mercy, that he is pleaſed to manifeſt of his Goodneſs to them, and to take them into a ſtate of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory with himſelf; nothing foreſeen at all in them being the moving Cauſe of God's chooſing of them; the only Cauſe being the good Pleaſure of his Will: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpoſe and Grace which is given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began.</hi> Chap. 2.19. <hi>Nevertheleſs, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> This Doctrine adminiſtreth great Comfort to the Saints, who feel the Work of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their Hearts, that their Salvation ſtandeth by God's eternal Decree that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be changed, and not in themſelves that daily might loſe it. How doth this make the Saints love God to the uttermoſt, who hath manifeſted ſo great Love to them? How doth this ſerve to humble them, that they had nothing of themſelves for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it freely came from God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly;</hi> I ſhall proceed to ſhew how the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is made the Head of the Elect, and the way through which electing Love doth paſs to every elect Perſon.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall prove it by theſe following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:34405:27"/>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe that our Nature in him was fitted as a Tabernacle for the receiving of the eternal Word, the ſecond Perſon in the Godhead; the Holy Ghoſt by his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Power working his Conception ſupernaturally, purifying that Matter of which his Human Nature was taken in the Womb of the Virgin, ſo that his Nature had not the leaſt Defilement in it. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and the Human Nature became united in him; to him run all the Promiſes, and to all the Elect as they are united in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For all the Promiſes of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen, unto the Glory of God by us,</hi> that through him come to partake of them: the Promiſes run to him, and fix in him as in an immoveable Rock that can never, be ſhaken.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> He is the Head of the Elect, and the way through which electing Love doth paſs to every elect Perſon, becauſe they are given to him as a Seed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.27, 28, 29. <hi>Alſo I will make him my firſt-born, higher than the Kings of the Earth. My Mercy will I keep for him for evermore, my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him. His Seed will I make to endure for ever, and his Throne as the days of Heaven.</hi> Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>And again, I will put my Truſt in him: And again, I, and the Children which God hath given me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> conveys natural Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34405:27"/>to all his Seed, and that which cauſeth the loſs of Communion with God; ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that conveys to all the elect Seed, which removes that which hinders Communion, and reſtores Communion to them: John 6.57. <hi>As the living Father ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo, he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> Here is three Livers; here is, 1. The Life of the Godhead. 2. Here is the Man Chriſt living upon the Godhead. 3. Here is the Believer living upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in one Perſon; the Divine Nature put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Life into the Manhood, and conveying of that Life to the Elect. Gal 3.16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made: He ſaith not, To Seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> Is Chriſt myſtical here meant, ſaith <hi>Leigh,</hi> then the Elect are comprehended in him: <hi>To</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made;</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt, and not to Chriſt in <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith <hi>Kendal</hi> againſt <hi>John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> It doth appear that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Head of the Elect, and the way through which electing Love doth paſs to every elect Perſon, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Saints from <hi>Abel</hi> to this very day. The Elect that were in the World before his appearance in the ſtate of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34405:28"/>his Humiliation, did all by Faith look at him, and through him were brought to the enjoyment of God; and upon him lay their hope of perſevering with God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Wherefore, ſeeing we are compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the Race that is ſet before us; looking unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our Faith.</hi> This Cloud of Witneſſes that look'd unto Jeſus, were the Saints from <hi>Abel</hi>'s time, in the 11th Chapter. The Saints that have been and are in the World in the times of the New Teſtament, through Jeſus do go to God, through Jeſus do enjoy Communion with God; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined into our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledg of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſum up this Chapter; Was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt comprehended in the Womb of the Decree of Election? Was the Union of the two Natures in the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt comprehended in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree as the Head of the Elect, and by the Decree appointed to be the Conveyer of Grace to every elect Perſon? Then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was acted and done by him was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Decree; and proves the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34405:28"/>of Grace and Redemption to be but one Covenant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, My Meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in two parts; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Perfect Obedience to the Law. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Penalty of it for the Elect, ſubſervient to the Decree of Election, and leading to anſwer the great Deſigns of it.</head>
                  <p>THE great God, that he might make good that threatning againſt Satan, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head,</hi> doth by the incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power of the Holy Ghoſt, firſt, ſanctify that Matter of which the Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was made, and then without the help of Man's Seed, did create or form it into the ſhape of Man, to which a living Soul was given, that ſo he might appear to be like his Brethren, the Elect. To this ſecond Man ſo wonderfully made, was the eternal Word, the ſecond Perſon in the Godhead,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34405:29"/>united in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and brought forth into the World, our <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, the Mighty God, the everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the wonderful Counſellor, the Prince of Peace:</hi> His Divine Nature being the expreſs Image of his Father's Subſtance, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it, it was no Robbery in him to be the Father's equal, and one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That he might be one with the Elect, he is wonderfully united to their Nature in the Womb of the Virgin; and that he might figure out the Miſery that all the Elect were in by Generation, he is born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger; typifying out, that by reaſon of their natural Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were like their firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> who was driven from the Preſence of God amongſt the Beaſts. He is put under the firſt Covenant, that he might fulfil the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. — <hi>Made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he is not only put under the firſt Covenant to give it a perfect Obedience, that in that Obedience of his the Elect might appear before God; but he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put under the firſt Covenant to give Satisfaction to the Wrong done to it by the Elect, as they ſucceſſively come into the World. Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34405:29"/>for us; as it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree:</hi> Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Foraſmuch then as the Children are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Fleſh and Blood, he</hi> (the eternal Word) <hi>alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame; that through Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil.</hi> Thoſe that ſtood in the Decree of Election as Children, coming into the World in ſuch a way by Generation, as brought them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the defilements of Sin, and ſo under the Penalty of the firſt Covenant, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word takes hold of their Nature, and by ſanctifying of it in Death, perfuming the Sacrifice by his Divine Nature, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the firſt Covenant is removed, and a Pardon laid in for the Children as they ſhall ſucceſſively come into the World, and have it applied to their Souls by the Spirit. They being intereſted in this Satisfaction, the Penalties of the firſt Covenant are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the executive Power of it taken out of the hands of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Having now by way of Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, opened the door into the Work of Redemption wrought by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I come, in the next place, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Soul-amazing Work under theſe three Heads; Firſt, In his perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by which he anſwered the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the firſt Covenant. Secondly, In
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34405:30"/>his giving up himſelf voluntarily to Death to anſwer the Juſtice of God for the Elect. Thirdly, How it was ſubſervient to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election, and anſwers the Deſign of it.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, I ſhall conſider this perfect Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and that I may the more clearly behold it, I ſhall conſider him with the Apoſtle, as a ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and as a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> brought to the trial of his Obedience, given up into the hands of Satan, to be ſifted and tried whether he would yield to the Tempter or no: <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1 to 11. From <hi>v.</hi> 1 to 3. we have the preparatory Work that went before the Temptation. And here we may view the great difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Perſons of the two <hi>Adams,</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> aſſiſted with all the outward Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that were poſſible to be afforded him, that he might withſtand the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the other put under all the outward Diſadvantages that might tend to make him yield to it. <hi>Then was Jeſus led up of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil: And when he had faſted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards an hungred.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was under no neceſſity of feeling that grievous Miſery that Hunger brings upon Nature, having always a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Table before him; the Temptation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34405:30"/>was in a place where there was no moving Cauſe to draw the Creature from his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, but his Diſobedience was a voluntary Act. But the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in his Human Nature, to prepare for the Temptation, was brought to feel the bitter Pain of Hunger, Nature having wanted Supplies of Food for forty days and forty nights together; and beſides, the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought in a place, even in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, deſtitute of all outward Support.</p>
                  <p>The next ſtep is to conſider the Progreſs of the Temptation it ſelf in its three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſaults: Firſt, From <hi>ver.</hi> 3 to <hi>v.</hi> 5. Secondly, From <hi>ver.</hi> 5 to <hi>v.</hi> 8. Thirdly, From <hi>ver.</hi> 8 to <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt; As to the firſt Aſſault, from <hi>ver.</hi> 3 to <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>And when the Tempter came unto him, he ſaid, If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe Stones be made Bread. But he anſwered, and ſaid, Man ſhall not live by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</hi> Let us compare this Temptation with the Temptation brought againſt the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difference that is betwixt the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contain'd in the Temptations.</p>
                  <p>In the Temptation that was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Eve,</hi> and handed by her to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, there is a Diſcontentedneſs with the Bounty already beſtowed, and a ſeeking by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34405:31"/>indirect means to attain to a greater pitch of Glory wrapt up in the Temptation; <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil.</hi> In the Temptation brought againſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Matter contain'd in the Temptation is more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid together; here is the ſupply of Nature's Neceſſities preſented, and here is the working of a Miracle propounded to ſupply the craving Neceſſities of his Human Nature; If thou conſent, Nature will be ſupplied, and the Power of thy Divinity will be manifeſted. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> looks not at what ſhould be the iſſue of going out of God's way to attain that which the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation preſented to him, and ſo is taken in the Snare: The Lord Jeſus looks to the Event, as appears in his Anſwer to the Devil, <hi>Man ſhall not live by Bread alone.</hi> It's the Bleſſing of God upon the Bread that makes it tend to the ſatisfying of Nature, and not Bread alone without his Bleſſing that can do it; and ſo he overcomes the Tempter.</p>
                  <p>The Devil being overcome in this firſt Aſſault, he prepares for the ſecond, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>And the Devil taketh him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a Pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſaith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down; for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34405:31"/>any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a Stone.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Not that another Scripture oppoſeth the true meaning of that Scripture cited by the Devil, but his addition to it, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down;</hi> for he is ſaid to tempt God, who preſumptuouſly, without neceſſity, ſeeks an Experiment of the Wiſdom, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth of God.</p>
                  <p>The Devil being overcome in this ſecond Temptation, prepares for the third; <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Again, the Devil taketh him up into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>And ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> Here he appears as a Liar, in ſaying that the Kingdoms of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Glory of it were at his diſpoſal; and he manifeſts his Pride in requiring the Son of God to fall down and worſhip him: which is implied in our Saviour's Anſwer, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Get thee hence, Satan; for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears from what hath been here laid down, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as the Head of the Elect, to give a perfect Obedience to the Law, or the firſt Covenant, did, notwithſtanding the aſſaults
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34405:32"/>of Satan, perſevere in his Obedience: which Obedience of his is in Scripture call'd <hi>God's Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe of the Union of the two Natures in his Perſon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was by the Power of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that his Human Nature was ſupported and inabled to withſtand the Temptations. But ſeeing I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak further of this Righteouſneſs when I come to ſhew how the Holy Ghoſt doth apply it to the Souls of poor, weary, heavy-laden Sinners, who fly out of ſelf-dependance unto him as to a Sanctuary, I ſhall proceed to the ſecond part of the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which conſiſted in his free and voluntary giving up of himſelf to anſwer the Juſtice of God for the Elect.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, I ſhall take notice of the Sufferings of his Soul: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to Grief; when thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for Sin.</hi> He never had committed Violence, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; but having undertaken to make Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God for the Elect, and to undergo the Penalty of the firſt Covenant, how did he feel the weight of Divine Wrath upon his Soul, as that bitter fruit which doth attend Sin? <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.37, 38. <hi>And he took with him</hi> Peter, <hi>and the two Sons of</hi> Zebedee, <hi>and began to be ſorrowful,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34405:32"/>and very heavy. Then ſaith he unto them, My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death; tarry ye here and watch with me.</hi> Mark 14.35. <hi>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and pray'd, that if it were poſſible the hour might paſs from him:</hi> Compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42, 43, 44. <hi>Father, if thou be willing, remove this Cup from me: nevertheleſs, not my Will, but thine be done. And there appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, ſtrengthening him: And being in an Agony, he prayed more earneſtly; and his Sweat was as it were drops of Blood falling down to the ground.</hi> He prayeth for freedom from that Cup and Hour, that is, from the grievous Torments that were upon his Soul: yea, ſo great was the Sorrow wherewith his Soul was ready to be overwhelmed, that he ſeeks for help by the Prayers of his poor drouſy ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſciples. There is an Aſtoniſhment or an Amazement which falls upon the Soul two ways, that is, an Aſtoniſhment of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and an Aſtoniſhment of Fear; the latter is here meant. He ſaw himſelf fallen on a ſudden into ſuch Diſtreſs, as he knew he could not be delivered from it: and being in an Agony he wreſtles with Grief and Fear which preſſed his precious Soul; yea, he ſtruggles and wreſtles with it, that he might not be ſo far overcome by it, as to bewray any kind of Impatience: he vents his Grief and Sorrow in theſe words, <hi>Not my Will,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34405:33"/>but thine be done.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had a Garden of Pleaſure to walk in, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath a Garden of Sorrow to weep and mourn in. The Garden in which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was placed had a pleaſant River running through it to water it; this Garden is watered with the Blood of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that is forced through his Veins by inward Grief and exceſſive Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: he not only is ſaid to have ſweat drops of Blood, but as it were to have bedew'd the place. Saith <hi>Janſen</hi> upon the words; <q>If we behold him upon the Croſs, he there complains of the withdrawings of the Divine Nature from him in theſe words, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come, ſecondly, to ſpeak of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Body; he experienced the fulfilling of the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my Back to the ſmiters, and my Cheeks to them that pluck'd off the Hair: I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting. Pilate,</hi> who was his Judg, pronounceth him innocent, and as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſign of his Innocency, waſheth his hands when he pronounceth Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, to clear himſelf of his Blood; yet ſcourgeth him, and deliver'd him to be crucified: <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.27, 28. <hi>Then the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Governour took Jeſus into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34405:33"/>Hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of Souldiers: And they ſtripped him, and put on him a ſcarlet Robe.</hi> The putting on the Scarlet Robe was for two Reaſons, the firſt, that the pain of his ſcourging might be increaſed upon him; the ſecond reaſon, to ſhew their Contempt of his Kingly Power. Ver. 29, 30. <hi>And when they had plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Crown of Thorns, they put it upon his Head, and a Reed in his right-hand; and they bowed the Knee before him, ſaying, Hail King of the Jews. And they ſpit upon him, and took the Reed, and ſmote him on the Head.</hi> They would not only mock him with the putting of ſuch a Crown on him, but by the ſame alſo ſhew their Cruelty to him by faſtening the Thorns into his Head. Ver. 32. <hi>And as they came out, they found a Man of</hi> Cyrene, Simon <hi>by name; him they compelled to bear his Croſs.</hi> It was a Cuſtom among the Romans, that thoſe Malefactors that were to be crucified did bear their own Croſs; but ſuch had been already the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sufferings of this innocent Lamb, that his Body was wearied, and made unable to undergo it; ſo a Stranger is laid hold of to carry it for him to the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ver. 38. <hi>Then were two Thieves cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him; one on the right-hand, and the other on the left.</hi> This Death of the Croſs was a very painful and ſhameful Death;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34405:34"/>the weight of the Body being born up by Nails ſtruck through the Hands and Feet, until they died by a languiſhing Death. He was numbered with the Tranſgreſſors, having a Thief on each hand, that we might be reckoned amongſt the Sons of God. His Arms were ſtretched open to ſhew his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to receive poor returning Sinners; with one Arm inviting the Jews, with the other the Gentiles, to flee from Wrath to come, by taking Sanctuary in him. O my Soul, doſt thou deſire to behold the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nature of Sin? Doſt thou deſire to know how hateful it is in God's ſight? Then take a view of thy ſuffering Lord. How was his precious Soul fill'd with Anguiſh! How was his precious Body (which was formd by the incomprehenſible Power of the Holy Ghoſt in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) wearied out by a painful Death? Behold this Man of Sorrow, that is acquainted with Grief! The Vail of the Temple is rent at his Death, to ſhew that he was pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away that Vail that interpoſed betwixt God and poor Sinners. The Sun was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being aſham'd to behold the Rage of the wicked againſt him: the Earth, who had long groaned under the Curſe for Sin, trembles to behold what the Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to remove the Curſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34405:34"/>
Thirdly, I proceed to ſhew, that the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ſubſervient to the Decree of Election, and anſwers the Deſigns of it. And I ſhall clear it up from theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Ye Men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>hear theſe words; Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>a Man approved of God among you, by Miracles and Wonders and Signs, which God did by him in the midſt of you, as ye your ſelves alſo know: Him, being delivered by the determinate Counſel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> I ſhall paſs by the Wickedneſs of theſe malicious Jews, and only take notice of what is contain'd in this 23d. Verſe, concerning the Decree of God, his determinate Counſel and Fore-knowledg, having determined it to be ſo; that is, that his Son ſhould thus ſuffer (which did not in the leaſt leſſon their Sin.) The reaſons of our Lord's Death in reference to the anſwering of the Decree, we have in <hi>John</hi> 17.19. <hi>And for their ſakes I ſanctify my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the Truth:</hi> Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one; for which cauſe he if not aſhamed to call them Brethren.</hi> By <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi> in theſe two Scriptures is not meant the ſanctifying Work of the holy Spirit, but his being ſet apart to the Work of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34405:35"/>Redemption performed by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, being the Head of the Elect; for their ſakes he willingly ſubmitteth to thoſe Conditions his Father required, to clear them from the Penalty of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>That the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſubſervient to the Decree of Election, and anſwers the Deſigns of it, doth further appear from <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>And all that dwell upon the Earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe Names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World.</hi> Here are ſome by eternal Decree ſecured from falling into Idolatrous Worſhip; here is the Death of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt taken in by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as the means appointed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to ſecure them from falling. To ſum up this Chapter; If the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be comprehended in the Decree of Election, as the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to anſwer that part of the deſign of the Decree, which was the ſatisfying the Conditions of the Covenant of Works, that ſo the Elect might be delivered from the Penalty of it, it will appear to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Chriſtian, that the Covenant of Grace and Redemption are but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Mediatorſhip of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in two parts; <hi>Firſt,</hi> In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and ſending of the Spirit to fit for the publiſhing of the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Spirits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the outward Declaration by opening the Heart, and ſo leading into the way; and keeping the Saints in it, ſubſervient to the Decree of Election, and anſwering the Deſigns of it.</head>
                  <p>IF we conſider the ſtate of the Elect as they come into the World, which, by reaſon of the natural Pollution that doth attend them, doth make them wholly unfit for Communion with God, it is neceſſary that they ſhould have one to be their Head, who doth partake both of the Nature of God, and of the Nature of Man, as the Perſon that was to ſtand betwixt them and God: He muſt be Man, of kin to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offending, that he might ſatisfy the Juſtice of God; for the Righteouſneſs of God did require that the ſame Nature which had committed Sin, ſhould undergo the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34405:36"/>due to Sin. And he muſt be God, that ſo his Juſtice, Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs being every way infinite and eternal, might make the Sufferings of that Nature to which it was united, of no leſs force than eternal Torment in others, to the ſatisfying of Juſtice for whom he ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>And altho the eternal Word did not actually take our Nature on him, that he might diſcharge the Elect from the Penalty of the firſt Covenant, until his appearance in the ſtate of his Humiliation; yet he ſtood as the Head of the Covenant, and through his Undertaking Mercies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyd to the Elect, and Judgments prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from falling upon them. We have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances in the Old Teſtament (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpecial occaſions) of his appearing in Man's Nature, and that as Mediator upon the account of the Elect: <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. <hi>And the Lord appeared unto him in the Plain of</hi> Mamre: <hi>and he ſat in the tent-door in the heat of the day. And he lift up his Eyes and looked, and lo, three Men ſtood by him; and when he ſaw them, he ran to meet them from the tent-door, and bowed himſelf toward the ground; and ſaid, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy ſight, paſs not away, I pray thee, from thy Servant.</hi> That one of theſe three was the eternal Word in Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>And the Lord
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34405:36"/>ſaid, Becauſe the Cry of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah <hi>is great; and becauſe their Sin is very grievous, I will go down now, and ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have done altogether according to the Cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</hi> That his Eye was upon the Elect in <hi>Sodom</hi> doth appear, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>And he</hi> (that is, <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>ſaid, O let not the Lord be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and I will ſpeak yet but this once: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure ten ſhall be found there</hi> (that are righteous.) <hi>And he ſaid, I will not deſtroy it for tens ſake.</hi> Compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. and the former part of the 22d Verſe, <hi>Haſte thee, eſcape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Son of God, who is the Head of the Elect, hath ſearched after the number of the Righteous in this place, and hath found them in it who belong unto him; they muſt be removed, before the wicked can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Scripture for the confirming of what I am treating of, is <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>was left alone; and there wreſtled a Man with him until the breaking of the day.</hi> That this Man is the eternal Word in Mans Nature will appear, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>And he ſaid, Thy Name ſhall be called no more</hi> Jacob, <hi>but</hi> Iſrael; <hi>for as a Prince haſt thou Power with God and with Men, and haſt prevailed.</hi> The Son of God ſympathizes with his poor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34405:37"/>afrighted Member, who was in danger to be deſtroy'd by his cruel Brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> Hoſea 12.4. <hi>Yea, he</hi> (Jacob) <hi>had power over the Angel</hi> (of the Covenant) <hi>and prevailed: he wept, and made Supplication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having opened the way into this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the foregoing Introduction, I come now to clear up the Matter containd in it; and I ſhall confine my ſelf to the times of the New Teſtament, which affords us the greateſt Light in theſe Truths. And, firſt, I ſhall ſhew that the ſending of the Spirit to fit for the publiſhing of the way of Salvation dependeth on his Interceſſion, as Mediator betwixt the Father and the Elect; and that the Spirit's accompanying the outward Declaration, and opening the Heart to receive the Truths held forth in the Goſpel Declaration, dependeth likewiſe, upon him. Secondly, That the keeping of the Saints in a way of Salvation dependeth likewiſe upon him. And under this Head I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the nature of that Work which the holy Spirit carries on in the Hearts of the Saints. Thirdly, and laſtly, I ſhall ſhew how it is all ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the Decree of Election, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Deſigns of it.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, I ſhall ſhew that the ſending of the Spirit for the publiſhing of the way of Salvation dependeth upon the Interceſſion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34405:37"/>of the Lord Jeſus. I ſhall divide this Head into two parts, and firſt treat of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Qualification wherewith the firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were indued: Secondly, the ordinary Qualification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a Perſon can have no real Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his own Soul, that he is call'd of God to that great Work and Service.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt; I ſhall treat of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Qualification wherewith the firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were endued. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt after he was riſen from the dead, bids his Diſciples ſtay for the Qualification wherewith they ſhould be fitted for the diſpenſing of the Goſpel, in theſe words, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>And behold, I ſend the Promiſe of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>until ye be endued with Power from on high:</hi> Compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>And when the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt was fully come, they</hi> (that is, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) <hi>were all with one accord in one place: And ſuddenly there came a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, and it filled all the Houſe where they were ſitting. And there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, as of Fire, and it ſat upon each of them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.</hi> As their Commiſſion was to preach the Goſpel to all Nations, ſo the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34405:38"/>for the Work was agreeable to the Commiſſion. Where Perſons do pretend to the ſame Commiſſion with the Apoſtles, and that they have as large an extent of Power and Juriſdiction as they had, and want the Qualification wherewith they were endued, they carry, ſaith the learned Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> the mark of Antichriſt in their Foreheads. That this Qualification for the firſt publiſhing of the Goſpel did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Interceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, for the gathering of the Elect out of the World, will appear, if we compare theſe two following Scriptures one with another, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.32, 33. <hi>This Jeſus hath God raiſed up, whereof we all are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: Therefore being by the right-hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this, which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35, 36, 43, 44. <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>opened his Mouth, and ſaid, Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of Perſons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him. The Word which God ſent unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>preaching Peace, by Jeſus Chriſt (he is Lord of all) To him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that through his Name whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of Sins. While</hi> Peter <hi>ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34405:38"/>fell on all them which heard the Word.</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.32, 33. the Qualification is laid down, without which <hi>Peter</hi> had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to preach the Goſpel to thoſe of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea;</hi> here is the Holy Ghoſt, as a fruit of the Lord Jeſus's Interceſſion, attending the outward preaching of the Goſpel, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it home upon the Heart with Power; the outward preaching of the Goſpel being the inſtrumental means appointed to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect out of the World unto God. Rom. 10.17. <hi>So then, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> By the Word of God here is meant the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel: The outward Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Goſpel doth contain in it theſe Truths appointed by God for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Elect; the Holy Ghoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the Vail of Darkneſs from the Heart, ſubjects the Heart unto the Truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the Heart to join with it.</p>
                  <p>I come, in the ſecond place, to treat of the ordinary Qualification to preach the Goſpel, without which a Perſon can have no real Satisfaction to his own Soul that he is called of God to that great Work and Service. The extraordinary Qualiſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the ordinary Qualification do not differ in a different Declaration of Truths delivered, but in a different work of the Spirit upon the Heart in diſcovering one and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34405:39"/>the ſame Truth; the one having it by the immediate impulſe of the Spirit of God overpowering all the Faculties of the Soul, and making it ſtoop to the leadings of the Spirit; in the other the holy Spirit works not ſo powerfully, but by giving in of Light to behold the Truth already delivered in the Word (and ſealed by Miracle) gives a Gift of utterance to declare it unto others.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing up this Qualification, I ſhall compare two Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>But unto every one of us is given Grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt. Wherefore he ſaith, When he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto Men.</hi> Which Gifts to Men he tells us in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. are <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt;</hi> the Body of Chriſt taking in the Saints until Chriſt's ſecond appearance. The Gifts here intended muſt be meant the ordinary Qualifications of the Spirit for the work of the Miniſtry, as the means appointed by God to gather the Saints into one Body, and to edify them when they are gather'd in, until they be brought ſafe to the Manſions of Glory, becauſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Qualification did ceaſe in a little time. To clear up this a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lock into 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>As every Man hath received the Gift, even ſo miniſter
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34405:39"/>the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. If any Man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God; if any Man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſut Chriſt; to whom be Praiſe and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> Here is contained in theſe words the Gift given from God the Father; here is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, through whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion this Gift is given; here is the nature of the Gift, which is the Spirit's inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings into the Oracles (or holy Scriptures;) here is the twofold end, God's Glory, and the Saints Edification. Where this Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is wanting, the Soul can have no real Satisfaction that it is called of God to that Work and Service : which I ſhall make appear by theſe following Renſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Altho Learning be very ſerviceable in order to have recourſe to the Original Text, for the underſtanding the Letter of the Scripture in the Original, for to ſtop the mouth of Gainſayers; yet the Darkneſs which is upon the Soul by Nature is not thereby removed. Neither can Learning of it ſelf comprehend that inward Life and Virtue which breaths in the holy Scriptures. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; neither can he know them, becauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34405:40"/>they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Without this ordinary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of which I have been ſpeaking, the Soul can have no real Satisfaction that it is called of God to the work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; becauſe that altho by Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, many weighty Truths may be collected from the Writings of experienced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have lived in the Power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, yet the inward work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being wanting in him that delivers them to others, they give an uncertain ſound; there being a want of an inward ſenſe of theſe Truths upon the Heart, and often a great deal of Man's Corruptions mixt with them, which they receive from the Veſſel through which they paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Without this ordinary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of which I have been ſpeaking, the Soul can have no real Satisfaction that it is called of God to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel, becauſe without it the Heart is not engaged in the Work that ſuch Perſons take upon them; neither are their Aims and Ends right in their entering upon this great Work, nor in the carrying of it on; the getting an outward Support in the World for themſelves being the thing they are moſt concerned for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Without this ordinary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of which I have been ſpeaking, the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34405:40"/>Soul can have no real Satisfaction that it is called of God to the work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; becauſe there wants a Union by Faith with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whence freſh Supplies ſhould be drawn for the diſcharging of that great Work: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there wants the knowledg of the worth of poor Souls, accompanied with yerning of the Bowels after their eternal good.</p>
                  <p>But Learning being put under the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of which I have been ſpeaking, and brought to be a Servant to it, is to be priſed as a very choice Jewel. Yet ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are Chriſtians degenerated from the Power of Chriſtianity, that Learning is made the main thing in this day; and their Hearts are taken up more with the curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Stile of the Miniſter, than with a ſerious ſearch about the matter delivered; and ſo their Faith ſtands in the Wiſdom of Man, and not in the Power of God.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed that the extraordinary and the ordinary Qualification to diſpenſe the Goſpel, with the holy Spirit's accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying of it as the inſtrumental means, to gather the Elect out of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, do depend upon the Interceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as being their Head and Mediator; I proceed, in the ſecond place, to ſhew, that the keeping of them in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34405:41"/>way of Salvation until they be brought to the Maniſions of eternal Reſt, is committed to him, and dependeth on him. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the nature of that Work which the holy Spirit carries on in the Hearts of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>In ſhewing, that the keeping the Saints in the way of Salvation until they be brought to the Manſions of eternal Reſt, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhall conſider the Power with which he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted as the Church's Head, his Prevalency with his Father for them, and his unlimited Power over all the Church's Enemies, for the Church's good.</p>
                  <p>Acts 2.36. <hi>Therefore let all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> The Father hath given him to the Elect, to be unto them Chriſt a Saviour, that by feeding upon his Perſon by Faith, they ſhould find that comprehended in him which ſhould be ſufficient to keep them for ever in the Love and Favour of God: and a Lord to them, as having an unlimited Power veſted in him. Mat. 28.18. <hi>And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth:</hi> Compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head, over all things to the Church,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34405:41"/>which is his Body,</hi> (by Church here is meant the whole Body of the Elect.) For the good of theſe he is ſet over the holy Angels, that they might be imploy'd by him for their good; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation? And gave him to be Head over all things to the Church,</hi> not Head unto all things. Neither Satan nor his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments have any benefit by this unlimited Power that the Father hath inveſted him withal, but the Elect only; yet his Power is of ſo large extent, as to overturn all the Plots and Deſigns of Satan, ſo as to make the iſſue of them end in the Church's good, and his own Glory: he countermines them, and either takes out their Powder by which they deſigned to blow up the Church; or in the ſpringing of it makes the Ruin fall upon themſelves. In clearing up a little further this Soul-refreſhing Truth, I ſhall open the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. <hi>But I would have you know, that the Head of every Man is Chriſt; and the Head of the Woman, is the Man; and the Head of Chriſt is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In opening the words of the Apoſtle, we are to underſtand <hi>the Head of the Woman is the Man,</hi> where the Woman is joyn'd in Marriage-Union to the Man; and by the <hi>Head of every Man is Chriſt,</hi> muſt be meant
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34405:42"/>every elect Perſon, who comes to witneſs a Union with him; and by <hi>the Head of Chriſt is God,</hi> we muſt underſtand him as having his Human Nature join'd to the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Godhead, and ſo brought into a nigh relation with the Father. Now that I may-come to ſome diſcovery of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Myſtery, I ſhall conſider the Relation which the Woman hath to her Husband by this Marriage-Union, and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that ſhe is inveſted with by this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That her Relation is very great doth appear, in that of two Perſons they are ſo far made one, that ever after this Knot of Marriage is tied, he looks upon her as a part of himfelf; ſhe loſeth her own Name, and takes the Name of her Husband, thereby ſhewing that ſhe is become a part of him: and ſo great is her Privilege by this Union, that how mean ſoever her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction hath been before Marriage, it is from that time forward forgotten, and ſhe is made a ſharer with her Husband in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Honour he is inveſted; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is confer'd upon him, ſhe becomes a ſharer with him in it. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>it a great Myſtery, but I ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and the Church.</hi> That is, he was for typifying out the Relation that was betwixt Chriſt and the Church by it.</p>
                  <p>And this leads me to the ſecond thing in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34405:42"/>the Apoſtle's words, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew how every elect Perſon doth become one with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſharer with him in the Honour the Father hath inveſted him withal. Every elect Perſon doth become one with the Lord Jeſus by the free ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of himſelf to them, this muſt be to bring about the Marriage. And O what Condeſcenſion is here in this excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he ſhould ſtoop ſo low, to take ſuch unworthy Creatures into ſo nigh a relation with himſelf! Perſons that before they become related to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are under the Penalty of the firſt Covenant; that is, are under the Sentence of the Law, whoſe Threatnings are no leſs than eternal Miſery: an eternal Excluſion of Soul and Body from the Preſence of God, being that which is comprehended in the Sentence. That this ſhould be the ſtate that the Elect are in before the offers of theſe Tenders, and that Embaſſadors ſhould be employ'd to make Tenders out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and the holy Spirit ſent from the Bridegroom to draw the Hearts of the Elect to condeſcend to this Marriage-Union; O wonderful amazing Work, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the different ſtate that theſe two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are in before Marriage! The Hearts of the Elect being drawn to accept him upon the terms he is offered; with what Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34405:43"/>is the Heart given up to him to be one with him? and how do they look upon themſelves ever after this Union to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in his Intereſt as it is in the World? Doth it call for a daily bearing the Croſs? With what willingneſs of Heart do they come to it, take it up? They look upon their Lord to be at preſent abſent from them, and therefore they are greatly concerned for his Truths white he is abſent from the World; they are willing to ſacrifice their Intereſts in the World to the Intereſt of Chriſtianity. That Perſon hath great cauſe to queſtion his Intereſt in Chriſt, whoſe Will is not ſo far brought over to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as to become a Martyr for him upon the account of his Truths. The Power to enable to go through ſo great a Work muſt come from God when call'd to it; but they do not find a drawing back of the Will from it, if he ſhall ſee it good to call them to it. Being united to him, what Privileges have they in preſent Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion? and what Privileges have they in Reverſion? At preſent they are brought into the ſtate of Children: <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>But as many at received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> Through him they witneſs what it is to have recourſe to God as a Father, and to be owned by him as his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34405:43"/>Children. In Reverſion they behold by Faith an eternal Inheritance, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Body. 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf heareth witneſs with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we are the Children of God. And if Children, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing is, to ſhew how the Lord Chriſt is brought into Relation with God the Father, and what thoſe Privileges are that he enjoys by virtue of this Relation. If I ſhould ſpeak of the Relation of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word with the Father which was from everlaſting, it cannot be declared by the Creature; therefore to meddle with this were high Preſumption: I ſhall only ſpeak of his Relation with the Father, as the ſecond Perſon in the Godhead join'd to our Nature; and as ſo united, he is ſtiled in Scripture <hi>the only begotten Son of God;</hi> the Relation of his Divine Nature with the Father, being not thereby diſſolved, but remaining firm; and his human Nature taken in to ſhare with the Divine Nature in this Relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:34405:44"/>
And as ſo related he enjoys very great Privileges from the Father; As, firſt, To ſhare with him in Divine Honour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>For the Father judgeth no Man; but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son: That all Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> As we honour the Father as the giver of every good thing to us, we honour the Son as the way through which it is given; <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>And hath given him authority to execute Judgment, becauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> That is, he ſhall exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſit on the Tribunal or Judgment-ſeat at the laſt day, and ſhall ſentence all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to their eternal ſtate.</p>
                  <p>I come now to treat of that Work which the holy Spirit carries on in the Souls of the Saints. The Children of God being brought by the Light of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſee themſelves under the Penalty of the Law, do come to witneſs by inward Experience the truth of the Apoſtle's words, Rom. 7.10. <hi>And the Commandment which was ordained to Life,</hi> (to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> while in Innocency) <hi>is to them the Meſſenger of Death.</hi> Actual Sins which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God, with the Penalty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to them, are in the Glaſs of the Law preſented before them; they are ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Rock of Preſumption, that they are in danger of ſplitting upon the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34405:44"/>Rock of Deſperation, but that an everlaſting Arm is put under to ſupport them. To theſe heavy-laden Sinners are the Tenders of Grace through a dear Redeemer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented outwardly, and theſe doth the Spirit draw inwardly: The Sins that they have committed outwardly, and the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they groan under inwardly, are brought with them to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they have nothing to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by to the Redeemer, but an inward fight and feeling of the Miſery that they groan under; they ſee a real need of a Saviour: and to theſe, when laid hold of by Faith, he is precious. The Evidence of a real Cloſure with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the acceptance of pardoning Grace through him, doth manifeſt it ſelf in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner. All the Children of God have not alike Evidence of a Cloſure; ſome come only to witneſs a Faith of dependance on him, and upon Grace through him, while others are taken into his Arms, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him, and drink deep of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God through him. To each of theſe Conditions, as having received through rich Grace ſome inward Experience of them upon my own Soul, I ſhall treat: And, firſt, Of the Faith of dependance, which doth diſcover it ſelf to the Souls of God's Children in this manner. The Soul
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34405:45"/>hath ſtrongly born in by the holy Spirit ſome ſuch abſolute Promiſe as this, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> They have the Evidences of the Father's giving them to him, and of his driving them out of ſelf-dependance to this Saviour; they have the aſſurance in the Promiſe of his acceptance in theſe words <hi>[him that cometh]</hi> extended to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and they have the certainty of their Salvation, that he <hi>will in no wiſe caſt them out.</hi> This, or ſuch like abſolute Promiſes being not only born in, but ingraven upon the Heart by the holy Spirit, the Soul is inabled by Faith to feed upon, and to reſt upon for Comfort, being throughly perſwaded of the faithfulneſs of the Promiſer, and of his Ability to perform what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: and from this doth the Soul draw inward Peace, going a begging through the World for a more full diſcovery of their Souls Beloved to them, and of the Fathers Love through him, but are denied; and many times do breath out their Souls unto God in words not much unlike their Lord's, <hi>My God, my God, Why doſt thou for ſake me?</hi> A Faith of dependance which knits the Soul to him is preſent, but the Evidence of God's Preſence with them is wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34405:45"/>
                     <q>It is upon an abſolute Promiſe that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to cloſe with Chriſt, ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton;</hi> for if the Promiſe upon which thou clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt be conditional, there being a Failure, through Frailty, of the Condition, the Comforts flowing from the Promiſe, will thereby ceaſe: therefore, ſaith he, it is upon an abſolute Promiſe that I deſire to truſt for Salvation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. I come in the next place to treat of that more full and clear Diſcovery of a cloſure with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Acceptance through him, which the Holy Spirit doth bring ſome of the Children of God to experience; and that is by leading a poor ſenſible Sinner to the Declaration of the Sufferings of the Bleſſed Jeſus, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Declaration into the Soul, and with it giving the Soul an inward Glance of the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom the Soul, by the help of the Spirit, doth draw ſuch Virtue as cauſeth an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate removal of inward Guilt which the Soul hath contracted by Sin; and under much Brokenneſs the Soul is brought to cloſe with him. Where this Cloſure is witneſſed, there doth an Intercourſe with the Father attend it: The Name of the Bleſſed Jeſus is with this Cloſure engraven ſo on the Heart? that the Injoyment of him becomes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſant and comfortable.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34405:46"/>
3ly. I ſhall proceed to ſhew how the Holy Spirit doth break down Corruption in the Soul, and carries on the Work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By diſcovering unto the Soul the polluting Nature of Sin; that unleſs the Soul be preſerved from it, Communion with a holy God cannot be enjoyed. It leads the Soul to watch againſt Temptations that draw into Sin; and it leads the Soul through Chriſt to the Father, for power to be kept from it. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator is the Perſon, upon the account of whoſe Worthineſs the Soul craves help from God: No ſooner is the Soul come before God to ſeek him in its private Addreſſes, but if Chriſt be enjoy'd by Faith, the Outgoings of the Heart are to him, and through him to the Father. The Soul claims a Right of Relation, or Kindred with him, and ſo uſeth Plainneſs of Speech with him about its State and Condition: and by beholding that its own nature in the Perſon of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſtands nighly related to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it puts him upon taking its Condition, and the managing of it, into his own hands, as being able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him; ſeeing he ever lives to make Interceſſion for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God doth put the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeking unto God for more light, that ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34405:46"/>thoſe Seeds of Sin that lie undiſcovered in the Soul, may not only be brought to light, but likewiſe be rooted out, as ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>Search me, O God, and know my Heart; try me, and know my Thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me; and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> Such is the nature of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Souls of the Saints, that it would have the very Seeds of Corruption removed: and as the Spirit of God doth put the Soul upon the uſing that means which God hath appointed for the ſubduing of Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; ſo it likewiſe doth not only beget a Principle of Grace in the Soul, by the Soul's Union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but by its inward Supplies it puts freſh Vigor and Life into it, by which the Heart comes more and more to be led forth unto God to ſeek after him, and engaged more cloſely to follow him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The H. Spirit doth encourage the Soul to perſevere in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Way that leads to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, by letting the Soul feel the peaceable Fruit that it doth bear in it in this Life, and likewiſe that eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ that it fits the Soul for in glory. The Saints ſow in Tears here, but they ſhall reap in Joy: they go on their way weeping, bearing pretious Seed; but at the Morning of the Reſurrection, then they ſhall appear bearing their Sheaves with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:34405:47"/>
I come now in the third place to prove how all this is ſubſervient to the Decree of Election, and anſwers the deſigns of it; <hi>Epheſians</hi> the firſt Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath choſen us in him, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love: Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Will; to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Compared with the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the firſt Chapter, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5th Verſes, <hi>Elect according to the Fore-knowledg of God the Father, through Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: Grace unto you, and Peace be multiplied. Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead; to an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you; Who are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Scriptures do fully prove the Truths of which I have been treating, the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34405:47"/>Oneneſs of the Covenant of Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: for, here the Decree as it proceeds from God is eternal; and paſſeth through Time into Eternity, to the effecting or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting what was deſigned by it. Can any Perſon ſeparate the means comprehended in the Womb of the Decree to attain the End, and not do manifeſt Wrong to the Decree it ſelf ? Let the ſerious Reader judg. Here is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Godhead, ſet up by the Decree as the Head of the Elect; all the Elect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in him. He appears in a State of Humiliation for the Elect; they have the Offers of Grace by him, and are brought to give Obedience to the Offers; have his Blood applied to their Souls for their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and through him have the Spirit ſanctifying them, and by his mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bringing them to the Glory which the Decree hath deſigned for them. All theſe outward Acts which were tranſacted in time, were but the gradual fulfilling of what was comprehended in the Decree which in it ſelf was eternal; which I hope doth prove that which was deſigned by the ſecond Part of this Book, that is, that the Covenant of Grace and Redemption is but one Covenant.</p>
                  <p>For a Concluſion; This Doctrine admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a great deal of Comfort to thoſe that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34405:48"/>have the Marks of Election already wrought in their Souls, to ſee their Salvation ſixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a ſure Foundation; and the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in ſuch a way as brings the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Motives with it to Humility and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, of engaging the Heart unto God.</p>
                  <p>And for thoſe that are under the means which lead to attain the End, it is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Doctrine to them; becauſe who are comprehended in the Decree, is a Secret wholly reſerved to God alone; and we no otherwiſe know that our ſelves or others are in it, but as we come under effectual Calling, which is that which opens the Door into it: Therefore it is in vain for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to think to know what God at preſent conceals from him, any other way but that which is of his own appointing. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord, revealed things to us and our Children.</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34405:49"/>Works, doth in his threatning againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, publiſh the glad Tydings of the Goſpel, and doth hold forth a Redeemer to come of the Seed of the Woman; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed; it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel.</hi> In which Threatning we may obſerve, that in the Word <hi>It</hi> and <hi>His</hi> the Perſon of the Redeemer was held forth unto our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and upon the performance of this Threatning againſt Satan, which did carry Goſpel-Grace in it, did the Children of God that lived in the World before <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: They by Faith beheld him that was to come; and through that Grace which was granted to poor Sinners in him, they were brought to walk with God, and to enjoy him.</p>
                  <p>In the proſecuting of the third Part of this Book, I ſhall by the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God make it appear, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as to the Matter of it, is one and the ſame with what is contained in this Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt Satan; and that what renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Grace God hath in a Covenant-way beſtowed upon any of his Children, as upon <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> they were but as ſo many Confirmations of the Certainty of a Redeemer to come, and tended to ſtreng-then this firſt Threatning, and to confirm
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34405:49"/>the Faith of the Fathers in the certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. That the Publication of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Grace did not br with God that were under the found of it, is very clear: It is not the bare Performance of thoſe Duties required by the Goſpel, that doth evidence Perſons being in Covenant with God, but the Principle by which they are enabled to perform them. An Inſtance of which we have in the two Brothers, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. <hi>And in proceſs of time it came to paſs, that</hi> Cain <hi>brought of the Fruit of the ground, an Offering unto the Lord.

                     <hi>Cain,</hi> who wants Faith, hath both his Perſon and his Offering rejected. How ſmall was the number of the Spiritual Seed ? yea, into what a ſmall compaſs was the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward face of the Church brought when God brought the Flood upon the old World ? the outward face of the Church confined to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family; <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11, 12, 13. <hi>And the Earth was corrupt before God, and the Earth was filled with Violence. And God looked upon the Earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all Fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth. And God ſaid unto</hi> Noah, <hi>The end of all Fleſh is come before me; for the Earth is filled with Violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the Earth.</hi> Although wicked <hi>Ham</hi> lived in this religious Family, whoſe Father hath this Character given him by God himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Noah, <hi>Come thou and all thy Houſe into the Ark, for thee have I ſeen righteous before me in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And although he was preſerved with his Father from the Deluge, his Heart is not the leaſt touched with it, but he ſeems rather hardned in his Wickedneſs, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that brutiſh Act of his to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he lay uncovered in the Tent. Although Chriſt had a Church in the World from <hi>Adam</hi> until <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time; and as far as Light can be afforded from the holy Scriptures, the Church did remain privately
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34405:50"/>in Families; yet that all thoſe that were in the Family were Members of the Church, much leſs brought into the Covenant of Grace, the Scripture gives us no ground to believe.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but a little wonder to behold the Confidence of ſome Men who do aſſert, That there was no Covenant of Grace before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> and in publick, in my hearing have affirm'd, that to make the Threatning againſt Satan the Covenant of Grace, is to make God covenant with the Devil. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; That when God ever took any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into Covenant with him, he alſo took all the Offspring, or all his Seed, into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him. To queſtion the Reality of ſuch Aſſertions, is to bring one under the Reproach of being Deniers of the Covenant of Grace; as if they had a mind to inhance a kind of Infallibility to themſelves, by making Perſons believe things from their pare Aſſertions.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP II.</hi> Of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the Old Teſtament Church-State: what was required to be a Member of it.</head>
                  <p>THAT the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had ſomething in it peculiar to him as a Believer, for the ſtrengthning of his Faith, and likewiſe relating to a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Offspring which were to proceed from his Loins, is that which I hope to clear up in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, relating to him as a Believer for the ſtrengthning of his Faith in the bleſſed Redeemer, who then was to come: He hath this exceeding great Favour beſtowed upon him, to have the Promiſe of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's coming renew'd unto him; and that by a new Promiſe, with this additional Favour annexed to it, that the Redeemer according to the Fleſh ſhould be of his Seed; which muſt certainly bring a great deal of comfort with it to believing <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>And I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe him that curſeth thee; and in thee ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> compared
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34405:51"/>with <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>And in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> recites the very Words of the Promiſe, and calls it <hi>a preaching the Goſpel before unto Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.8. <hi>And the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that God would juſtify the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed;</hi> Compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made. He ſaith not, To Seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> From which Words I do obſerve this Truth, That the Covenant entred into by God with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> was but a renewing of the ſame Promiſe of a Meſſiah to come, which the Threatning in the 3d Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and the 15th Verſe contained in it, granted unto him for the ſtrengthning of his Faith in the Meſſiah; whoſe Day of appearance he beheld by Faith, and rejoyced to ſee it, and ſo was juſtified before God by that which Faith beheld in theſe new Covenant Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Rom. 4.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>And being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed he was, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo to perform: And therefore it was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for Righteouſneſs. Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:34405:52"/>
As <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith was led to believe this Promiſe which related to the Coming of the Meſſiah, and thereby was privileged in a large ſhare of the Mercies which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Meſſiah; ſo all true Believers that can lay claim to the ſame Faith with bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> are reckoned his Spiritual Seed, and become Sharers with him in the ſame Mercies. Gal. 3.28, 29. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus. And if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed, and Heirs according to the Promiſe.</hi> As faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> was made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of ſuch pretious Promiſes by Chriſt, to whom all New Covenant Promiſes do firſt run; ſo every Believer coming to ſhare in the ſame Faith with <hi>Abraham,</hi> lays claim to the Promiſes with him, and becomes a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in them. <hi>Abraham</hi> in reſpect of the Greatneſs of his Faith above others, ſtands as a glorious Pattern before them; where we may behold him led forth to God by Acts of Obedience in a wonderful, manner, not ſtaggering how God would accompliſh his Promiſes, but minding his Obedience: So that he that had received the Promiſes, (in <hi>Iſaac</hi>) offers up this his only Son, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting that God was able to raiſe him from the dead, from whence he received him in a Figure. We may by looking at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34405:52"/>what paſſed betwixt God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> as in a Glaſs, behold his ſincere Obedience to God, and God's Faithfulneſs to him in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to a tittle what he had promiſed to his Servant: which may be matter of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to us humbly to relie upon our Heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p>Having treated of God's renewing the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Coming of the Meſſiah of his Seed; I come in the next place to treat of that numerous Offspring which were to proceed from him, and the Privileges of which his natural Seed as ſuch, were made Partakers. In the 15th of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> ver. 4, 5. God promiſes him a numerous Offspring, <hi>And behold, the Word of the Lord came unto him, faying, This ſhall not be thine Heir;</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Eliezer</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) <hi>but he that ſhall come forth out of thine own Bowels ſhall be thine Heir. And he brought him forth abroad; and ſaid, Look now towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and tell the Stars, if thou be able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them; and he ſaid unto him, So ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> As God did perform his Promiſe to his Servant <hi>Abraham,</hi> in bringing forth ſuch Multitudes of People from him as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe treats of; ſo he is pleaſed to afford them Privileges above the reſt of the World for many Generations together, which are held forth in the 17th Chapter of <hi>Geneſiſ:</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:34405:53"/>Where God is pleaſed to grant unto the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for a Poſſeſſion, and a Church-State ſet up amongſt them, wherein his Worſhip ſhould be carried on in ſuch a way as was of his own appointing until the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Meſſiah: <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from between his feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the People be.</hi> That God's End in affording this People his Worſhip, before the reſt of the World, was thereby to gather the Elect that were amongſt them into the Covenant of Grace, is clear from a multitude of Scriptures; but that their Admittance to be Members of this Old Teſtament Church, which was a Privilege that they enjoy'd by Birth-right, did of it ſelf bring them into the Covenant of Grace, is againſt both Scripture and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. doth reckon up the many Privileges that they enjoy'd. In the 6th Verſe he breaks forth, <hi>Not that the Word of God hath taken none effect;</hi> (yea it had anſwered the end for which it was appointed, the Elect were gathered in by it) <hi>But all are not</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael. Ver. 7. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all Children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi> That is, they which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34405:53"/>
                     <hi>the Children of God; but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> Theſe Scriptures, if compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. do let us clearly ſee what that Covenant was, even a Church-ſtate, unto which the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Fleſh had admittance to be Members by virtue of their Birth-right, and that by the very appointment of God. This Covenant having anſwered the end for which it was appointed, is ended; and a better ſtate, in reſpect to the Church, doth ſucceed it, which I hope to clear up when I come to treat of the Church of Chriſt now in the times of the New Teſtament.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Ordinances of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Church; what they did point at to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him by Generation; and what they pointed at to his ſpiritual Seed.</head>
                  <p>IN the laſt Chapter I ſhewed the nature of that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Offspring, as they proceeded from him by Generation, that it contained in it the Promiſe of an Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34405:54"/>Inheritance, to all his Seed; God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſhew forth ſome particular marks of his Bounty to them, as they were the Offspring of this holy Man. To which Covenant or Promiſe Circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Seal, even in the time of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of that Old Teſtament Church; and the Paſchal Lamb afterwards added, when they were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a Confirmation of the fulfilling of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with their Father <hi>Abraham:</hi> of which Covenant the Apoſtle ſpeaks in Heb. 8.7, 8, 9. <hi>For if that firſt Covenant had been faulileſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond. For finding fault with them, he ſaith, Behold, the days come (ſaith the Lord) when I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the Houſe of</hi> Judah: <hi>Not according to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers, when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>becauſe they continued not in my Covenant; and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in theſe words doth refer us to the bringing the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the imbodying of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into a Nation, and God's ſetting up his Worſhip amongſt them, which the 17th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the Covenant there mentioned, carried in the Womb of it; the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34405:54"/>Inſufficiency of which Covenant lay not only in the unvailed Adminiſtration of Goſpel-Grace, which was darkly typified forth in the times of the Old Teſtament, but chiefly in the want of internal Grace: from having a ſhare of which Grace the greateſt part of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were excluded; not the Elect who were of his Offspring, but thoſe which were put off with Earthly Enjoyments, which they by their Rebellions in proceſs of time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, the Forbearance and Patience of God being wearied out.</p>
                  <p>Having, by way of Introduction, opened the way to that which I intend to treat of in the following Diſcourſe, I ſhall lay down theſe three Heads to enlarge on. Firſt, That the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were (in <hi>Gen</hi> 17.) taken into Covenant with God; unto which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant temporal Mercies were annexed, and Circumciſion given as a Seal of the performance of it on God's part. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That as the Covenant mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. carried in the Womb of it the imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> into a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Nation, in order to have that Old Teſtament Church-ſtate ſet up amongſt them; ſo their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the appointing the Paſchal Lamb, was to ſhew them that God was actually on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing what was contained it the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34405:55"/>Thirdly, Where internal Grace did accompany theſe Ordinances, and other parts of that Old Teſtament Worſhip, the Elect Seed were brought to have ſpiritual Mercies convey'd to their Souls through it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; That the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.) taken into Covenant with God, unto which Covenant Temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were annex'd, and Circumciſion given as a Seal of the performance of it on God's part, doth appear as it is laid down from <hi>ver.</hi> 4 to <hi>v.</hi> 15. extending it ſelf not only to all his Seed that ſhould deſcend from him by Generation, but likewiſe to thoſe that were born in his Houſe, or bought with his Mony. <hi>And the uncircumciſed Manchild, whoſe Fleſh of his fore-skin is not circumciſed, that Soul ſhall be cut off from his People; he hath broken my Covenant.</hi> That all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were brought into this Covenant had inward Mercies convey'd to their Souls, croſſeth the words of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid unto God, O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live before thee!</hi> If he had underſtood that this Covenant into which <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was going to be taken by the initiating Ordinance of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, had been the Covenant of Grace, he needed not have doubted of that, there being a ſincere performance of what was required of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s part on the behalf
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34405:55"/>of <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> But we find by God's Anſwer, that there was not that intended by that Covenant for him; but as the Covenant promiſed an Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> tho he had not that Land, yet he ſhould have other Earthly Greatneſs which ſhould carry with it the performance of what was held forth by the Covenant unto the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ver. 20. <hi>And as for</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>I have heard thee: Behold I have bleſſed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly: twelve Princes ſhall he beget, and I will make him a great Nation.</hi> This is that which the Covenant intended for him, and doubtleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſo look upon it, or otherwiſe he would have interceded farther for <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Evident it is that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was taken into this Covenant contain'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did circumciſe him as the Covenant required, yet we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to repreſent the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. <hi>For it is written, that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sons; the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman. But he that was of the bond-woman, was born after the Fleſh; but he of the free-woman was by Promiſe. Which things are an Allegory; for theſe are the two Covenants, the one from the Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gendereth to Bondage, which is</hi> Agar. Mr. <hi>Edward Leigh</hi> in his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34405:56"/>Annotations upon the New Teſtament doth ſpeak ſo fully to the Truth, that I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his words at large. <q>
                        <bibl>Ver. 23.</bibl> 
                        <hi>Born after the Fleſh.</hi>] That is, by a bare natural Power of Generation. By <hi>Promiſe.</hi>] That is, not ſo much by the natural ſtrength of Parents, as by virtue of God's Promiſe, which bound his Truth to ſet his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency at work above Nature. Ver. 24. <hi>Which things are an Allegory.</hi>] That is, being the things that they were, ſignify the things that they were not; a Figure of ſome other thing myſtically ſignified by them; that is, they repreſent or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the two Covenants. <hi>For theſe are the two Covenants.</hi>] That is, diſtinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, of Works and Grace, firſt and ſecond Covenant; not the Covenant of Grace differently adminiſtred in the Old and New Teſtament. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not under the Covenant of Grace in any ſenſe; <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> repreſented all Men regenerate and unregenerate, all which are under the Covenant of Works and Grace. <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi>] Which came thence, being there publiſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated; the Law and Covenant of Works. <hi>To Bondage.</hi>] That is, begets not Children of a free and ingenuous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, loving God, and out of Love doing him Service, and meerly of his Grace, Love,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34405:56"/>free Favour and Promiſe expecting their Reward; but Bondſlaves, which out of a fear of Puniſhment, or hope of Reward do Service, and expect the Reward for the worthineſs ſake of their Works. <hi>This Covenant is</hi> Hagar.] That is, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Hagar,</hi> ſo called for a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: Firſt, For its Condition, becauſe it begets all Children to Bondage. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, For Subordination, <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Maid; the Law is a Servant to the Goſpel, and Goſpel Ends.</q> If, as Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not under the Covenant of Grace in any ſenſe, I do wonder how he can, as he doth in other places, make it the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and Circumciſion the Seal of that Covenant? for of it was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> made a partaker, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23, 24. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>took</hi> Iſhmael <hi>his Son, and all that were born in his Houſe, and all that were bought with his Mony,</hi> (according to the appointment of the Covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.) <hi>every Male among the Men of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Houſe, and circumciſed the Fleſh of their fore-skin, in the ſelf-ſame day, as God had ſaid unto him.</hi> A ſecond Proof for the Confirmation of what I have laid down under this firſt Head, that the Covenant mention'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold forth Earthly Things to be enjoy'd by the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (by the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I intend the great number of his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34405:57"/>fleſhly Seed, as ſeparated from the Elect which were amongſt them.) That this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant did only hold forth Earthly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that Circumciſion was only a Seal of theſe things to be enjoy'd by them, will further appear from that account which the Scriptures give us of <hi>Eſau.</hi> If the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. unto which Circumciſion is annexed, be the Covenant of Grace, and the Infant-ſeed of Believers by virtue of their Parents Faith have a right to new Covenant-Mercies, and ought to be ſealed with the Seal of the Covenant; how doth this agree with <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto her,</hi> (that is, to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah</hi>) <hi>Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People ſhall be ſeparated from thy Bowels; and the one People ſhall be ſtronger than the other People; and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12, 13. <hi>It was ſaid unto her,</hi> (that is, to <hi>Rebekah</hi>) <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the yopnger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated. What ſhall we ſay then? is there <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid.</hi> He as an abſolute Soveraign over the Works of his hands, may diſpoſe of Perſons and Things as pleaſeth him. But to return to the matter in hand: here is <hi>Eſau</hi> the Seed of believing <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſo without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy he had a Covenant-right to what was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34405:57"/>intended by the Covenant to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as ſuch, yet even while in the Womb excluded from any ſhare in new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Mercies: it muſt then follow, that this Covenant did not convey new Covenant-Mercies, but was a Covenant of Peculiarity to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> others ſe there is a failure in the Covenant, but it is the higheſt Wickedneſs to imagine, there ſhould be any on God's part in performing what he covenants to give. But if we look upon the Covenant here as intending Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſſings, there was no failure of theſe Bleſſings, either to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> or <hi>Eſau,</hi> or to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Jacob,</hi> after they were imbodied into a Nation, and had that Church-ſtate ſet up amongſt them, until by aggravating Sins and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion they forfeited their right to theſe Covenant-Mercies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; As the Covenant mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. carried in the Womb of it the imbodying of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> into a ſeparate Nation, in order to have that Old Teſtament Church-ſtate ſet up amongſt them; ſo their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the appointing of the Paſchal Lamb, was to ſhew forth to them, that God was punctual in the accompliſhing what was contain'd in the Covenant. Altho God in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. did enter into Covenant with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34405:58"/>
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with all his natural Seed, yet the accompliſhment of what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Covenant, in reſpect of the gathering the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> into a National Church, was not accompliſhed until many hundred years after. Exod. 2.23, 24, 25. <hi>And it came to paſs in proceſs of time, that the King of</hi> Egypt <hi>died, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſighed by reaſon of the Bondage, and they cried; and their Cry came up unto God, by reaſon of the Bondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with</hi> Abraham, <hi>with</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and with</hi> Jacob. <hi>And God look'd upon the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and God had reſpect unto them.</hi> He remembred what he had promiſed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and ſo remembers it as to take in hand the accompliſhment of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.17. <hi>And I have ſaid, I will bring you up out of the Affliction of</hi> Egypt, <hi>into the Land of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebuſites, unto a Land flowing with Milk and Honey.</hi> This the Apoſtle calls the entering into Covenant with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the accompliſhing of what was contain'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. the faultineſs of which Covenant lay in the Promiſe of Earthly Enjoyments, which were fading and liable to be loſt, and the want of inward Grace,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34405:58"/>by which God comes to be enjoy'd, and new Covenant-Mercies preſented to the Soul. That the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. doth thus lay it down, is plain to every Perſon that hath not a mind wilfully to ſhut his Eyes againſt the Truth. For the further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what is ſaid, look into Deut. 29.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Theſe are the words of the Covenant which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>to make with the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the Land of</hi> Moab, <hi>beſide the Covenant which he made with them in</hi> Horeb. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>called unto all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſaid unto them, Ye have ſeen all that the Lord did before your Eyes in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and unto all his Servants, and unto all his Land; the great Temptations which thine Eyes have ſeen, the Signs and thoſe great Miracles: Yet the Lord hath not given you a Heart to perceive, and Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, unto this day.</hi> Notwithſtanding this Chapter does contain in it a renewal of the Covenant to bring them to the accompliſhment of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. yet we find not in the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a promiſe of internal Grace, without which no Perſon can be ſaid to be brought into the new Covenant: for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wonderful Trials that they went through, and the Soul-amazing Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which they received from God, the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34405:59"/>holy Spirit being wanting inwardly to faſten theſe upon their Hearts, and to ſoften their Hearts before God; theſe great Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God on their behalf quickly wore off their Hearts, and they forgot all his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. That the gathering the Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a Nation, and the appointing of the Paſſover, led to point unto the natural Seed the fulfilling of what was contain'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. which was the enjoyment of Earthly Inheritances, will appear, in that the admittance unto the Paſſover run to the ſame Perſons to whom Circumciſion was granted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. And that it was to be a Sign to the natural Seed of God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Promiſe in bringing them to the enjoyment of the Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was but a Type of that Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> reſerved for the ſpiritual Seed, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.25, 26, 27. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs when ye be come to the Land, which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promiſed,</hi> (Gen. 17.) <hi>that ye ſhall keep this Service. And it ſhall come to paſs, when your Children ſhall ſay unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What mean you by this Service? that ye ſhall ſay, It is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Lord's Paſſover, who paſſed over the Houſes of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in</hi> Egypt, <hi>when he ſmote the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and delivered our Houſes: And they bowed the Head and worſhipped.</hi> It is clear from a multitude of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34405:59"/>Scriptures, that from the firſt giving forth of the Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. until the coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> from <hi>Jacob</hi> downwards, were made Partakers of many outward Privileges, even thoſe of them that were ſtrangers to internal Grace, which no other People that ſtand in the outward part of the Worſhip of God in Goſpel-times can lay claim unto, <hi>(viz.)</hi> an Entail of a particular Enjoyment of the Worſhip of God amongſt them for many Generations together. But this will fall under Conſideration when I come to treat of the New Teſtament Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; Where internal Grace did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company theſe Ordinances of Circumciſion, and the Paſchal Lamb, with other parts of the Old Teſtament Worſhip, the Elect Seed were brought to have ſpiritual Mercies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to their Souls through it. <hi>Abraham</hi> hath that Honour conferr'd upon him, to be a Father not only to a numerous Offspring, who did enjoy an Earthly Inheritance by Covenant-right as deſcending from him; but likewiſe a Father of the ſpiritual Seed, both Jews and Gentiles, who ſhould ſhare with him in the ſame Faith, and ſo come to ſhare in thoſe precious Promiſes made to him as a Believer through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. That he ſtood as a Father to this twofold Seed, doth appear from the words of our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34405:60"/>Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.37. <hi>I know that ye are</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<hi>'s Seed; but ye ſeek to kill me, becauſe my Word hath no place in you.</hi> That is, ye are only of that Seed, who by virtue of deſcent from him, do enjoy the Privileges of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments. Ver. 39. <hi>They anſwered and ſaid unto him,</hi> Abraham <hi>is our Father. Jeſus ſaith unto them, If ye were</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ye would do the Works of</hi> Abraham. That is; if you were of his ſpiritual Seed, and of the ſame Faith with him, it would ſhew it ſelf by its Works, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith did, who ſaw my day of appearance as a Redeemer, and rejoiced.</p>
                  <p>Of his natural Seed as ſuch I have already ſpoken, and the Privileges they enjoy'd. I now come to treat of his Spiritual Seed that did deſcend from him, who did not come to their Right by being the Offspring of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Abraham,</hi> but by being of the ſame Faith with him; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children: but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called. That is, They which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God: but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> That is, as <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Birth was not by the natural ſtrength of the Parents, but by virtue of God's Promiſe, which bound his Truth to ſet his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency on work to perform what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34405:60"/>even ſo it is with all the ſpiritual Seed. Without the moving of the ſame Power upon the Heart to ſubject the Heart unto him, none could come into that ſtate which will give its Evidence according to the Scriptures, that they are of the ſpiritual Seed. As it was by preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> or a renewing of the Promiſe of a Meſſiah to come, which had been given out in the threatning againſt Satan, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>Abraham</hi> was brought into Covenant; ſo it was by the means which the Wiſdom of God did think fit to make uſe of to convey the knowledg of the Meſſiah to come unto the Souls of theſe <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> who were to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual Seed: and the ordinary means was that Worſhip appointed by God in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Church, to theſe that were of years. The way that God takes to convey Grace to elect Infants in all Ages, being a Secret which he is pleaſed not to diſcover unto us, I deſire to leave them to his rich Grace which flows to Sinners through a dear Redeemer, and to his own way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it unto their Souls, and ſhall return to treat of the matter in hand. As <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Father to a twofold Seed, and the believing <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to proceed from him by Generation, as well as the Unbelievers; and as both theſe were to be imbodied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34405:61"/>into one Nation and Church for many Generations, ſo the natural Seed having the things intended for them by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſealed unto them, it was neceſſary that his ſpiritual Seed ſhould have their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Mercies ſealed to them. <hi>Abraham received the ſign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed; that he might be the Father of all them that believe.</hi> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Ordinance was not the Evidence of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual Seed; but that which was figured out by it unto the ſpiritual Seed was the Evidence; which was the having their Hearts circumciſed, Corruption removed, and Grace planted in the Soul: for altho an outward Ordinance be the means leading to the inward, where the Spirit concurs with it, it is from the inward that the Soul receives Comfort, being thereby brought into a condition to enjoy Communion with God, and through Faith to behold the Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> before it. As the Paſchal Lamb was appointed to figure out to the natural Seed, that God was accompliſhing his Promiſe in bringing of them to an Earthly <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo where the ſpiritual Seed were led by Faith to behold that the Paſchal Lamb was but a Type of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Paſſover, they through Faith were brought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34405:61"/>to behold that God was upon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of his Promiſe, in bringing of them to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> The Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9, 10. ſhews us that the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Church-ſtate was but <hi>a Figure for the time then preſent, in which were offered both Gifts and Sacrifices, that could not make him that did ſacrifice perfect, at pertaining to the Conſcience, which ſtood in Meats and Drinks, and carnal Ordinances impoſed on them until the time of Reformation.</hi> Not that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were carnal in reſpect of the things typified by them, and apprehended through the help of the Spirit by the ſpiritual Seed; <q>But, ſaith Mr. <hi>Hilderſam,</hi> ſuch as carnal Men might perform, and very ſutable to the Diſpoſition of a carnal Heart.</q> God by his Wiſdom ordering his Worſhip in this manner, that ſo the natural Seed and the ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from the firſt ſetting up or forming that People into a Church, might remain imbodied together until the times of Reformation; that is, the New Teſtament Church-ſtate. Their Privileges by fleſhly right do then end, and the natural Seed ceaſeth from being counted any longer a Church or People to God, but as they fall in with the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and receive the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification which the New Teſtament Church calls for in order to be a Member of it.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34405:62"/>Rom. 11.19, 20, 21. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then, The Branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. Well; becauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith: be not high-minded, but fear. For if God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.</hi> Theſe words, I think, do comprehend the whole matter of which I have been treating in this Chapter: the Branches that are broken off are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> or, as <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, the Children of the Fleſh; ſuch as tho deſtitute of ſpiritual Grace in their Souls, yet by virtue of Birth-Privilege did enjoy, as a Branch from <hi>Abraham,</hi> a right of Memberſhip in the Old Teſtament Church, and a ſhare in the Worſhip of it. But the time of the Old Teſtament Church-ſtate being expired, the aim of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being to gather together the ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the fleſhly Jew muſt be broken off, and the believing Gentile muſt take his place, that ſo the Church in the times of the New Teſtament may conſiſt of the ſpiritual Seed: and if he ſpared not the natural Jew, becauſe there was a want of the Qualification, <hi>be not high-minded, but fear;</hi> for if thou wanteſt the Qualification, thou haſt not long to continue a Member of the Church of Chriſt in the times of the New Teſtament. I have in treating of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34405:62"/>contain'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. gone from the common Opinion of Expoſitors; and through Mercy, I can appeal unto the Lord, that I have deſired ſincerely to follow the leadings of his holy Spirit in his Word. If I have varied in any thing from the holy Scriptures, which I deſire to follow as my Rule and Guide, if any can ſhew me my Error, and will do it in the Spirit of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhall be greatly obliged to them. I muſt deſire the Reader's favour to overlook the weakneſs of the Stile in which theſe Truths are laid down, and to look at the Truth it ſelf, which ſhines the cleareſt when it appears in its own native Beauty. If it agree with thy Experience, bleſs God for it; for thou mayſt ſee in reading of the Appendix, which contains the Author's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Advice to his Children, that the Author hath nothing to glory in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: It was by rich and free Grace alone that he was brought to ſee the Truth, and to give Obedience to it: It is through rich Grace that he receives ſtrength to walk in it; and it is by Grace alone that he hopes to come to that eternal Bleſſedneſs that is held forth by it.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the New Teſtament Church, and what is required to be a Member of it.</head>
                  <p>BEfore I come to the matter contained in this Chapter, I ſhall ſpeak of the Church of Chriſt in general; and ſo it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole Elect Body, from the Fall to thoſe that ſhall be living at Chriſt's ſecond Perſonal Appearance. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>For this cauſe I bow my Knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Of whom the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in Heaven and Earth is named.</hi> Some of the Family are gotten to their reſt, others are conflicting with the World; and ſome have only their being in the Decree of God, to appear at the time appointed for them. The Church ſo conſidered, is the Body of Chriſt which he hath redeemed by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Blood, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, when preſented to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Laſt day: But of the Church thus conſidered, are many Members who are not brought to be Members of a gathered Church, conſtituted according to the Rule of God's Word. That <hi>Lot, Job,</hi> and his Friends, were of the Body of Chriſt, and ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34405:63"/>Members of the Church, I think no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will deny; yet it doth not any where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that thoſe were Members of the Old Teſtament Church, who never imboided to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo became thereby viſible to the Nations round about them. As Chriſt in the times of the Old Teſtament had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members who were not brought into the Church, ſo hath he likewiſe in the times of the New Teſtament. The idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath aſſumed to her ſelf the name of <hi>the Church,</hi> or <hi>the Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo was owned for many Ages by the great Ones of the World, while the Members of Chriſt were not viſible to the World, and in many places not one unto another.</p>
                  <p>In not diſtinguiſhing the Church as it is here laid down, ſome Perſons have driven on ſtrange Deſigns againſt God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by their Cry, That out of the Church there is no Salvation: Which is true if we conſider the Elect Body, to whom Chriſt was given as a Saviour; but will not hold true to any particular gathered Church; for many Members of Chriſt are ſo ſcatter'd in the World, that for many Ages it hath been, and at this time is morally impoſſible that they ſhould be gathered into a Body according to the Rule of the Word. Of the Church, as taking in the whole Body of the Elect, do I reckon Elect Infants: Whether
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34405:64"/>only all Believers Infants, or Unbelievers Infants likewiſe be ſo, to whom Grace is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Holy Spirit, I leave as a Secret which God is pleaſed to reſerve unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But that they are uncapable of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in a viſible gathered Church in the times of the New Teſtament, and have no Right to the two Ordinances of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lord's Supper, will appear in the proſecuting of this and the next Chapter, if regard be had to the Holy Scriptures as a Rule and Guide unto us. By holding forth the Purity of the Church, I do not thereby unchurch thoſe ſeveral ſorts of Proteſtants that differ from the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Baptiſts in many things, yet do hold with them the Foundation, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as Redeemer, and the one Mediator betwixt God and Man; in oppoſition to the many Mediators brought in by the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet if regard be had to the Holy Scriptures as a Rule, many of the Proteſtant Churches will appear to have been building upon the Foundation, Wood, Hay, and Stubble; they have retained in their ſeveral Churches ſomething that hath been handed down unto them from the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Papiſts, and not from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Scriptures. Although God hath born with theſe Churches ſeveral Ages, as he bore with the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34405:64"/>is viſible that his Preſence is greatly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them, and may end in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching of them, when the Church comes wholly to be delivered out of her Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs State, if there be not a hearty and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy return unto him.</p>
                  <p>Having by way of Introduction open'd the way into what remains chiefly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in this Chapter, I ſhall lay down theſe two general Heads, as that which may take in the whole matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Treat of the Nature of the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Goſpel under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is required to be admitted a Member of the viſible Church, according to the Rule laid down in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall treat of the Nature of the Publication of the Goſpel under the New Teſtament; and that is in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the Publication of it in the times of the Old Teſtament. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt was then held forth under ſuch Types and Figures, that the end for which they were inſtituted in the Church, was beheld with great difficulty; ſo that the Saints themſelves that were waiting for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were ignorant of the manner of it, and the nature of that Deliverance that ſhould
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34405:65"/>be wrought by him, being much upon the expectation of a viſible Kingdom in this World, and outward Glory attending of it, not being brought clearly to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his firſt and ſecond Appearance: But as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>God who at ſundry times and divers manners ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things.</hi> The New Teſtament which was given forth by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, doth take off the Vail from the Old; and as to that part of it which concerns the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is an Expoſition of it. Our Lord tells the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4.23. <hi>But the hour cometh and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> Under the times of the Old Teſtament the Worſhip of God lay much outward, the Body being greatly exerciſed in it; they had killing of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they had material Fire to burn the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice withal, and material Salt to ſeaſon the Sacrifice. But under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Worſhip moſt of all concerns the Soul; it is ſo far ſpiritual, that the Spirit of God muſt be the Unfolder of it, and calls at the firſt glance for the Soul to apprehend the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Perſon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34405:65"/>held forth in it. For without a Heart true unto him, no acceptance of the Worſhip, neither the Worſhipper: The Salt which our Worſhip muſt be ſeaſon'd withal, muſt be inward Sincerity; the Fire inward Zeal, engaging the Heart with God, when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the worſhipping of him, which will not fail to keep the Body in a decent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture with it. How low doth the Apoſtle go when he ſpeaks of the Old Teſtament Worſhip? Heb. 10.1. <hi>For the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things can never with theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which they offered year by year continually, make the Comers thereunto perfect.</hi> By the Law the following words ſhew he intends the Ceremonial Law, which was appointed by God during that Diſpenſation to typify out that which is with ſuch Clearneſs preſented unto us in the New Teſtament. And in comparing of theſe together, the Apoſtle doth not vouchſafe to grant unto the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law to be an Image of the other, but a Shadow; a Shadow is not ſo much as an Image, nor an Image ſo much as the thing it ſelf. It is a Metaphor taken from Painting: Painters are wont with Chalk or a Coal, to draw out the thing which they propoſe to themſelves to expreſs. Which rude Picture is call'd a <hi>Shadow</hi> for the obſcure Repreſentation: Then with the Pencil they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34405:66"/>bring on the lively Colours, that it may be a diſtinct and expreſs Likeneſs of a thing; which is properly call'd an <hi>Image.</hi> There being ſo vaſt a Difference in the Matter of the Worſhip betwixt the Old and New Teſtament, it is very ſtrange to me to ſee holy Men run back to the Old Teſtament, to warrant their Practice for ſuch things, which they want a Warrant for from the New.</p>
                  <p>Having found out the nature of the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Goſpel under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will not be very difficult to find out what fort of Perſons are the viſible Members of the Church: which leads me to the next thing to be handled; What is required to be admitted a Member of the Church according to the Rule laid down in the New Teſtament. And that is a laying hold of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, and of that rich and free Grace which is extended to Sinners from God the Father through him, accompanied with an outward Profeſſion of their Faith before thoſe to whom they join themſelves in Church-fellowſhip, and an outward Declaration of their ſincere deſire to walk with the Church as Members of it, according to the Rule of the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They firſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and to us by the Will of God.</hi> It is impoſſible but Hypocrites and Formaliſts ſhould creep into the Church, becauſe Man
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34405:66"/>judgeth only by outward appearance: it is God alone that can behold the Heart. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the admittance of them depends upon the Church's Judgment, and the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them as ſincere, and not as Hypocrites or Formaliſts; for if either of theſe were diſcoverable before admittance, the Church would not accept them; <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Then</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>himſelf believed alſo, and was baptized.</hi> By <hi>believing</hi> muſt be meant an outward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his believing; for it doth appear that his Heart had not laid hold of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for if it had, he would not have been ſo ignorant how the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt was given, ſo as to think to procure it by Mony: but being diſcovered, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells him, <hi>Thy Mony periſh with thee;</hi> ver. 23. <hi>For I perceive thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity.</hi> That is, notwithſtanding thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion of Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thou art in a ſtate of Sin and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, which, if continued in, will at laſt bring forth the Bitterneſs of eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To prove that the New Teſtament doth require a Work of true Converſion upon the Heart, as that which qualifies or fits a Perſon to be a Member of the viſible Church; and that no pretence of fleſhly right, as being of believing Parents, will do it, I ſhall offer theſe following Reaſons.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34405:67"/>Firſt; Becauſe the Entail which gave the fleſhly Seed right of Memberſhip to the Church, ended with that Old Teſtament Church-ſtate: for altho the grievous and abominable Sins of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did cauſe the Lord to bring very heavy Judgments upon them, and often to ſend them into Captivity before the face of their Enemies, yet they were not unchurched; neither was the Worſhip of God taken from them for their Wickedneſs, and given to another People: and the great Reaſon was, becauſe it was by an Act of Grace, that this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was granted to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they ſhould be ſeparated from the reſt of the Nations, and have the Worſhip of God ſet up amongſt them. And the ſame Grace that extended this Favour to them above the reſt of the World, was pleaſed that an Entail to ſecure the continuance of the Favour granted until the coming of the Meſſiah, ſhould be a part of the Grant it ſelf; as appears from the words of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until</hi> Shilo <hi>come.</hi> He ſpeaks it with a <hi>ſhall not,</hi> to ſhew, that altho their Sins might bring other Judgments upon them, yet this Judgment was reſerved to fall upon them for their ſlighting the Meſſiah. The Lord Chriſt lays this before the Jews in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34405:67"/>of a Houſholder planting a Vineyard, Mat. 21.33. <hi>Hear another Parable: There was a certain Houſholder which planted a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and hedged it round about, and digged a Wine-preſs in it, and built a Tower, and let it out to Husbandmen, and went into a far Country.</hi> This <hi>Houſholder</hi> is God the Fathers; this <hi>Vineyard</hi> which he plants is his affording the People of the Jews the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of having his Worſhip ſet up amongſt them; and hedged it round about, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to ſhew that it was a Favour granted only to that People, for the reſt of the Nations had not that Privilege granted to them; <hi>and digged a Wine-preſs in it,</hi> that is, appointed ſuch Ordinances as were the inſtrumental Means in the hand of the holy Spirit, to bring the Elect that were amongſt them into Communion with God: <hi>built a Tower,</hi> that is, the glorious Temple; <hi>and let it out to Husbandmen, and went into a far Country;</hi> that is, gave forth a Grant with an Entail, that they ſhould enjoy it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations, until the ruining of their Church and State for their grievous Sin in crucifying the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Ver. 38, 39, 40, and 43. <hi>Therefore ſay I unto you, The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> By <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> he means his Worſhip, which is the inſtrumental
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34405:68"/>Means to fit for the Kingdom of Heaven. The Old Teſtament Church-ſtate being ended, that which ſecures the continuance of the New Teſtament Worſhip amongſt any People, is the improving of it to God's Glory, and the good of their immortal Souls. God's removing of his Worſhip from <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> from one Nation of <hi>Europe</hi> to another, from one City to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a ſufficient Evidence to us upon what terms his Worſhip is continued amongſt us. When the Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> were threatned with a Diſſolution, no mention of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with their believing Fathers, or their being ſaved by their Parents Faith; Rev. 2.5. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt Works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thy Candleſtick out of its place, except thou repent.</hi> So that it is plain, that it is not by any Right deſcending from believing Parents to Children, that they are admitted Members of the New Teſtament Church, or have the Worſhip of it continued amongſt them. I do foreſee that this will go to the quick with a great many Perſons, whoſe Cries are, if the Children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be not admitted to be Members of the New Teſtament Church, you make their State and Condition to be worſe under the New Teſtament, than under the Old. To which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34405:68"/>I anſwer, that I do not ſtraiten the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Believers Children; for I ſhew'd before, that Salvation doth not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Church-Memberſhip, or upon the admittance to outward Ordinances; for many of God's Children were ſaved who were not admitted to be Members of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church: yet I do ſtill own it is a great Privilege where it hath its Warrant from the Word of God; for then they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Bleſſing upon it, to anſwer the end for which he appoints it.</p>
                  <p>Some Perſons do ſay that believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Children are not admitted to Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into a viſible Church, but God with the believing Parent doth take their Infant-ſeed into the Covenant of Grace. But they do not conſider that Infants admittance to the Ordinance was by virtue of a right of Memberſhip, as Members of the viſible Church under the Old Teſtament. That Believers Childrens Privilege is better than theirs that are Unbelievers, doth appear in this; that thoſe of them that die in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy have the Prayers of their believing Parents put up for them, in the Name of him through whom rich Grace hath been extended unto them: and I think a Heart drawn out to wreſtle with God by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parent on behalf of a dying Infant, and a Heart enabled to leave the dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34405:69"/>to the rich Grace of God which flows through the undertaking of the bleſſed Jeſus, will yield a more abiding Comfort to the Parent than a pretended federal Holineſs will afford them; the Parent many times at the ſame time being under the ſenſe of inward Corruption. And as to theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing Parents that are grown to years of Underſtanding, and are not as yet admitted to be Members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, if the Parent be found in the diſcharge of his or their Duty to them, they will in Truth and Faithfulneſs lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them what is required to their orderly admittance, and will ſeek to the Lord for them that they may enter in at the right Door; for the Heart comes not to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, neither to receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from Ordinances, but as it firſt is brought into a right frame, and hath its Warrant from the Word of God that it is in the way of his Appointments: the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt be in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Reaſon why the New Teſtament doth require a Work of true Converſion upon the Heart, as that which qualifies or fits a Perſon to be a Member of the viſible Church, is, becauſe without it the Duties required from one Member to another cannot be diſcharged, as they are concerned in one and the ſame Intereſt on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34405:69"/>the behalf of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo there is a holy Watchfulneſs required over one another, in order to the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of theſe Duties which their Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them. And, ſaith the Apoſtle, if one Member ſuffer, all the Members ſuffer with it; or one Member be honoured, all the Members rejoice with it. Where a Church is imbodied together according to the order of the New Teſtament, our Lord hath left us an excellent Rule to walk by, that ſo theſe things that may tend to bring Diſhonour upon the Church may be ſtopt when they firſt begin to break forth; or otherwiſe, that things may be managed in ſuch a way as that the Church may free themſelves, of the Offender. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>Moreover, if thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go tell him his fault betwixt thee and him alone: if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more; that in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word may be eſtabliſhed. But if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> If thy Brother do thee any wrong, or elſe ſin againſt God, and thou be privy to it; for that Sin may be ſaid to be againſt us, which is againſt God, in reſpect of that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34405:70"/>common Intereſt that ſuch Perſons are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged mutually in: If a ſinning Member have his Sin laid before him by that fellow Member that is privy to it, and he bear to be told of his fault, ſo as to be brought to an acknowledgment of it before the Lord, and to repent of it and return from it, then that Member is gained: but if he be ſtubborn, let him be again admoniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Witneſſes, not one only, but two or three Witneſſes, that ſo it may appear that means are made uſe of for the reclaiming of the Offender. But if he ſhall neglect to hear theſe two or three Witneſſes, <hi>then tell it to the Church;</hi> that is, let his Offence, and his perſiſting in it after Admonition, be laid before the Church to whom the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der belongs as a Member: but if he neglect to hear the Church in admoniſhing of him of his Offence, <hi>then let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man and a Publican;</hi> that is, as a Perſon that is a Stranger from the Church, and not belonging to it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third Reaſon why the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament requires a Work of true Converſion upon the Heart, as that which qualifies or fits a Perſon to be a Member of a viſible Church, is, becauſe as every Member doth receive Grace in a meaſure, ſo it is their Duty to communicate of that Grace to their fellow Member, holding the Head, the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34405:70"/>Chriſt, who by Faith ties and knits every Member of the Body unto him; and from that fulneſs that is in him gives forth Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to every individual Member; ſo that as they grow up by the ſtrength of Grace, they are enabled to add ſomething to the edifying and ſtrengthning of their fellow Members, and to add to the Beauty of the Church to whom they do belong: for altho many Men that are Members of the Church may not have received ſuch Gifts as to fit them for publick Exerciſe in the Church, much leſs Women, who are ſtrictly forbidden the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.34, 35. yet in their private Diſcourſes one with another, whether Men or Women, if the Matter which they diſcourſe of tend not to the advancing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the exalting of the Grace of God through him, by which they may be edified, ſuch Perſons little conſider what is required of Church-Members, in order to the diſcharge of their Duty to God, and to one another.</p>

He by his appearance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what was figured out by the Old Teſtament Worſhip, it muſt follow that there was an end put to that Worſhip, and with the Worſhip to the Church-ſtate likewiſe.

The New Teſtament Church hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have the Son of God to be the firſt Diſcoverer, by his own Mouth, what was required to be a Member of it, and to be the Appointer of the Ordinances to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it: <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>He ſaith unto them, But whom ſay ye that I am? And</hi> Simon Peter <hi>anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-jona; <hi>for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven. And I ſay unto thee, that thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church; and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. Leigh</hi> upon the words faith, that it was the Judgment of <hi>Hilary, Cyril, Chryſoſtom, Theophilact</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that by the Rock is not meant <hi>Peter</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the Faith which he had profeſſed in Chriſt: an inward diſcovery of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, accompanied with an outward Profeſſion of the fame, is the Matter of which the New Teſtament Church is built. 1 Pet. 2.4, 5. <hi>To whom coming, as to a living Stone, diſallowed indeed of Men, but choſen of God, and precious; ye alſo as lively Stones, are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Every Member of the Church is not fitted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34405:72"/>to be a Publiſher of the Goſpel, but every Member of the Church, if ſuch an one as the Word requires, is brought through Chriſt to receive the Grace of God; and from an inward feeling of this Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to offer up a thankful Heart devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. For the gathering in of ſuch Members into the New Teſtament Church is the Commiſſion given forth to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and direction is given to admit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus gathered to the initiating Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Water-Baptiſm, as appears from the words of the Commiſſion, and the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Apoſtles by virtue of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the World.</hi> Here three things lie fair from the words without any wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: Firſt, Outward Teaching, the inſtrumental Means appointed by Chriſt, and made uſe of by the Holy Ghoſt to bring to the inward knowledg of him, and the acceptance of Grace through him, thereby to be made fit Matter for the Church under the New Teſtament. This I have ſpoken
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34405:72"/>ſo fully to in the laſt, and in this Chapter, (that the viſible Church of Chriſt under the New Teſtament doth conſiſt of ſuch as are call'd out of the World by true Converſion, to lay hold of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Grace through him, that I need not enlarge upon this firſt Head. The ſecond thing contained in the Commiſſion, is the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch to the initiating Ordinance of Baptiſm: <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Then they that glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received the Word, were baptized; and the ſame day were added to them about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls.</hi> Thirdly, Here is the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of what is commanded by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in theſe words, <hi>And lo, I am with you alway unto the end of the World.</hi> The Apoſtles liv'd not till the end of the World, therefore I am with you and your Succeſſors, who ſhall be fitted by me for the preaching of the everlaſting Goſpel, appointed to gather the Elect unto God, until this World come under a Diſſolution. As by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and the Practice of the Apoſtles upon the Commiſſion, Baptiſm is appointed by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the initiating or entering Ordinance into a viſible Church of Chriſt under the New Teſtament; ſo his laſt Supper is appointed by him to be practiſed by theſe that are in a viſible Church-ſtate, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19, 20. <hi>And he took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34405:73"/>gave unto them, ſaying, This is my Body which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me. Likewiſe the Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi> The Apoſtles were the viſible Church at that time, and to them doth he appoint the Supper Ordinance; and from the Appointment of Chriſt, doth <hi>Paul</hi> recommend the Practice, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Ordinance to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> After he had condemned their ſinful abuſe of the Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. from <hi>ver.</hi> 20 to 23. at <hi>ver.</hi> 23, &amp; 24. he lays before them how that Ordinance was appointed by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be continued in his Church: <hi>For I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betray'd, took Bread: And when he had given Thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my Body which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This Cup is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in my Blood; this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</hi> As the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm was appointed by Chriſt to be adminiſtred to thoſe who were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according to the Rule of the Word to be Members of the Church; ſo it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed likewiſe to be the entering Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34405:73"/>into a viſible Church-ſtate, and the Ordinance of the Lord's-Supper to theſe that were viſible Members: Which ſerves to clear up the former part of this Chapter, what the Ordinances are, and what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to fit for the partaking of them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond branch of this Chapter is what they do hold out when adminiſtred accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To have the Ordinances adminiſtred according to the Rule of the Word, there is required, that the Adminiſtrator, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to whom the Ordinance is adminiſtred, and the Way of the Adminiſtration, have its Warrant from the Word of God; for God is a God of Order, and not of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In the ſecond Part of this Book, and the third Chapter, I ſhew'd that there was an extraordinary and ordinary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The extraordinary Qualification was that of the Apoſtles, who had a large exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Power accompanying them, granted by Chriſt for the firſt planting of the Churches. That this Office of Apoſtleſhip is ceaſed is clear, ſeeing there is no appearance of the Qualifications to that great Work in any of the Diſpenſers of the Goſpel in theſe latter Ages; ſo that for any Perſon either to preach or adminiſter the Ordinances as ſent out by Chriſt as Apoſtles, favours of Pride and Preſumption. But there is a more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34405:74"/>Qualification from Chriſt to diſpenſe the Goſpel, which depends upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightnings of the Spirit in the Word, and a Gift of Utterance to declare it unto others; and for the carrying on of this Work, God hath pleaſed to raiſe up ſeveral Perſons to diſpenſe his Truth before they bore any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Church, or over it. But the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Ordinances of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which particularly concerns the Church, it ſeems to me by the Rule of the Word, that before ſuch Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinances, there ſhould be a ſetting apart of fit Perſons for Office by the Church, and an Approbation of their Choice by the Elders of other Churches, together with the laying on of Hands, and likewiſe a ſolemn and earneſt ſeeking unto Almighty God, through Jeſus Chriſt, for a Bleſſing upon the Perſons whom they have choſe: And this is to be done as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Qualification whereby to inveſt ſuch Perſons into a Right duly to adminiſter the Ordinances. I do remember that after God had fully convinced me of the Ordinance of Believers Baptiſm, I went a great many miles to come under the Ordinance; but the Perſon to whom I went not being able to give me a ſatisfactory account of his regular Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as an Adminiſtrator, I was conſtrained to return unbaptized, although at that time
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34405:74"/>I had a very great deſire to have been made a Partaker of that deſpiſed Ordinance. This may ſerve to ſhew, that to have the Ordinances adminiſtred according to the Rule of the Word, there ſhould be a fit Adminiſtrator.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; To the orderly Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinances there is required a right Subject, or ſuch a Perſon as the Rule of the Word doth require. And, firſt, I ſhall ſhew the Qualifications required of thoſe that come to the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and that is, Repentance for Sins that are paſt, Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſeeking unto God through him for pardoning Grace and Power to walk with him. Acts 22.16. <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy Sins, calling on the Name of the Lord.</hi> Compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.37, 38. <hi>And</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thine Heart, thou mayſt; and he anſwered and ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. And he commanded the Chariot to ſtand ſtill; and they went down both into the Water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch, <hi>and he baptized him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Rule doth require a Qualification to fit Perſons for the orderly admittance to the Ordinance of Baptiſm, ſo doth it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the orderly admittance to the Lord's Supper. 1 Cor. 11.27, 28, 29.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34405:75"/>
                     <hi>Wherefore, whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. But let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup: For he that eateth aad drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lord's Body.</hi> He that eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unworthily, that is, as an ignorant Perſon; not diſcerning the Lord's Body, that is, not having any inward apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him by Faith upon their own Souls, or come not with that holy humble Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and with that due regard which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch an holy Action. If it be ſo that the Rule doth require Qualifications of thoſe that come to the Ordinances, then it doth condemn the Practice of ſuch who do adminiſter without any regard whether the Qualification be there or no. And, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It greatly condemns ſuch who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of a ſpiritual Baptiſm, and a ſpiritual Supper, do lay aſide the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church. The more clear the Evidences are of the Work of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Heart, it tends to hold forth the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons right to the Ordinance of Baptiſm. Acts 10.47. <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> We may
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34405:75"/>in theſe words behold the different Path that Truth and Error doth walk in: Error makes a pretended Enjoyment of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a ground to lay aſide the outward; Truth makes the real Enjoyment of the inward, the Qualification it ſelf to partake of the outward; and the more clear that the Enjoyment of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt doth outwardly manifeſt it ſelf, it leads the Adminiſtrator unto a chearful adminiſtring the Ordinance to ſuch Perſons. <hi>And he</hi> (Peter) <hi>commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe that do lay aſide the Supper-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, do ſay that Chriſt is come, and therefore the Supper-Ordinance is of no longer continuance. But if ſuch Perſons would ſeriouſly conſider what the coming of Chriſt is which they ſpeak of, they would do well; for if by coming inwardly into the Soul, and the Holy Ghoſt's manifeſting him in the Soul by the Glaſs of the Goſpel, be meant, this is the Qualification to come to the Ordinance, and ſo he is come to every ſincere Chriſtian. 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love; in whom tho now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory.</hi> Compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your Hearts by Faith:</hi> This dwelling of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, is the inward
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34405:76"/>diſcerning of him in his Sufferings; which being wholly wanting in thoſe that do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the outward part of the Ordinance, they eat and drink Damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not diſcerning the Lord's Body. But if by being come, they intend ſuch a coming as to exclude the Expectation of the ſecond Perſonal Appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Whom,</hi> the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>the Heaven muſt receive until the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things;</hi> then they deſtroy one of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. The Saints in this day do in a meaſure witneſs with the Apoſtles the inward Enjoyment of him by Faith; and by the ſame Faith that they liv'd in, do expect the perſonal return of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks fully to this, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> They could not be brought into the ſtate of Children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the inward Enjoyment of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith; for this is the Evidence of Sonſhip: <hi>and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be</hi> in Eternity; we do but as in a Glaſs behold the Glory that the Children ſhall there be made partakers of: <hi>but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Not

                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing to be treated of is, that the way of adminiſtring the Ordinances be kept to according to the Rule of the Word, and that is as to the Ordinance of Baptiſm, a burial of the Body in Water in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Buried with him by Baptiſm into Death. Leigh</hi> in his Note upon the words of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <q>The Apoſtle (ſaith he) alludes to the manner in which Baptiſm was then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, which was to plunge the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Water; after which they put on new Garments; whence thoſe manners of ſpeaking uſed in Scripture, <hi>to put on Chriſt, to put off the old Man and put on the new.</hi>
                     </q> Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> agrees with <hi>Leigh</hi> as to the manner of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Ordinance of Baptiſm in the Primitive Church, and tells us that it was altered from plunging of the Body under Water, to ſprinkling in the Face, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Coldneſs of this Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; but from whence the Power is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to make any alteration in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34405:77"/>from its Primitive Inſtitution, this that holy Man ſhews not; as if the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not ſubject to the Power of God, and he were not ſufficient to preſerve his Children in their Obedience to him in his own Appointments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The way of adminiſtring the Supper-Ordinance we have ſet down by the Lord Jeſus, who was the firſt Adminiſtrator, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, 27, 28. <hi>And as they were eating,</hi> (that is, the Paſſover) <hi>Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my Body.</hi> The Bread put for the thing ſignified by it, which was the Body of Chriſt. Ver. 27. <hi>And he took the Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it.</hi> Ver. 28. <hi>For this is my Blood</hi> (that is, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or figure of his Blood poured forth) <hi>of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This leads me to the next thing, What the Ordinances do hold forth when admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred according to the Rule of the Word.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall firſt treat of the Ordinance of Baptiſm, which conſiſts of two parts, the one outward, the other inward; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part I have ſpoken to already, which is a Burial of the Body in Water; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part figured out by the outward, is the Burial and Reſurrection of the Lord
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34405:77"/>Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life. For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his Death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection.</hi> As the outward Declaration of the Goſpel is the inſtrumental Means in the hand of the Holy Ghoſt, to convey that which is held forth by it, which is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto the Soul; ſo is the Ordinance of Baptiſm the Means appointed by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and made uſe of by the Spirit to convey that which is held forth by it. The outward of it ſelf conveys nothing, it is only made uſe of by the holy Spirit to ſet before the Soul what is figured out by it. The Burial of the Body holds forth the Burial of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Benefits which we receive by it, which is a diſcharge from the Penalty of Sin; and our riſing out of the Water, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the Benefits which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by it, which is to walk with God in newneſs of Life, by Power received from the Father, through the Interceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The holy Spirit accompanying the Ordinance, doth let the Soul ſee what Chriſt hath gone through to free it from Hell, and to procure for it the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34405:78"/>Enjoyment of Heaven; which inward ſight by Faith knits the Soul to the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle calls it a being planted into the <hi>likeneſs of his Death,</hi> and into <hi>the likeneſs of his Reſurrection.</hi> The Believer is let into Chriſt, ſo as to draw that ſpiritual Life, by which he lives unto God, from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he not only lives in the Enjoyment of the Father, but doth likewiſe convey of that ſpiritual Life unto all his Members, in a meaſure. For the further clearing up and confirming the truth of what is held forth by the Ordinance of Baptiſm, I ſhall open the Apoſtle's words in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>By which alſo he went and preached unto the Spirits in Priſon;</hi> (<hi>He,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Divine Nature, went by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Miniſtry, and preached Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, while the Ark was building, to thoſe Souls who for their Impenitency were caſt into the Priſon of Hell.) <hi>Which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time were diſobedient, when once the Long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing,</hi> (the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God towards the old World. continued, and <hi>Noah</hi> preached Repentance to them) <hi>wherein few, that is eight Perſons, were ſaved by Water. The like Figure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, even Baptiſm, doth now ſave us, (not the putting away the filth of the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God) by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34405:78"/>the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, which is Water, and which puts away the filth of the Fleſh by the burial of the Body in it, is not that which ſaves, but it is a Figure of that which doth ſave; the Spirit accompanying the Ordinance when it is adminiſtred, by the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God; that is, the anſwer of a believing Heart, which by Faith lays hold of that which is figured out by it, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Death and Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>The Lord's Supper hath likwiſe two parts, an Outward and an Inward; the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, is the Bread broken and eaten, the Wine poured forth and drunk by the Believer; the Inward part is his Fleſh cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and his Blood ſhed for the ſake of his Members. Luke 22.19, 20. <hi>And he took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, ſaying, This is my Body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo the Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi> The Martyrs, being preſs'd by the Papiſts to ſhew how the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was preſent in this Ordinance, owned, that as Bread and Wine was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Body in feeding upon it to its Nouriſhment; ſo the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt was apprehended by the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34405:79"/>Soul in feeding upon him to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul. The Bread and Wine is not the Body, but a Sacramental Figure by which the Body of Chriſt is repreſented to us: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread and drink of this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall lay before you the way that God hath taken to bring me to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf by Faith.</p>
               <p>I was in my younger years exceedingly beloved of my Mother, ſo that her very Life ſeem'd almoſt bound up in me; and tho I do believe ſhe had a Work of Grace upon her Soul, yet her Love to me did not run in that pure Channel which it ought to have run, that is, to have made my immortal Soul the great Object of her Love and Care: But her Indulgence to me in my tender years tended greatly to heighten Sin and Corruption in my Soul; for I choſe for my Companions the profaneſt Boys in <hi>Bridling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> and altho I was not gotten to ſuch a pitch of Profaneneſs as ſome of them, yet I took delight to hear them belch out their Wickedneſs; and frequently at our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we had profane Ballads, which I was as induſtrious to learn to ſing as any of them: my poor Mother did know of my Companions, but I do not think that ſhe did believe that they were altogether ſo wicked as they were, for they generally appeared moderately ſober before her. I do think that it is one of the greateſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that belongs to Parents, to endeavour
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34405:80"/>to caſt their Children among other ſober Children; for what avails all Admonition that can be given to a Child, if as ſoon as we have done, we deliver it up into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I do not think that it is in Parents power to give a Principle of Grace to their Childen, but it may be in their power to give a check to the outbreakings of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which may greatly hinder its growth: Prov. 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I was about ſeven years old, and a Scholar at the Free School, a wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did befal me: Being at play with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty Scholars with me in the Green be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church, and a poor Woman at the Well-ſide drawing Straw, I laid my Breaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the great blue Stones that lay about the Well, to ſail my Ship in it, it being full of Water, and ſo went head forward down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Well; neither my Play-fellows ſeeing me fall into it, nor the poor Woman that was by: but altho no Eye ſaw me, yet the Eye of the Almighty was over me, and his ſparing, pitying Love was towards me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very unfit to go into Eternity, having no knowledg of God, neither of the worth of my precious Soul; and he by his Wiſdom open'd a way to ſave me in ſuch a manner, that all concern'd in me might know that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34405:81"/>he had done it. A poor old Woman, whoſe Name was <hi>Alice Brown,</hi> that liv'd right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Well, had hung on a Pan with Water to lay Leven, but a lump of Soot fell down out of the Chimny (which had been ſwept but three days before) into her Pan, ſo that ſhe caſt out the Water and came to the Well for more, and ſeeing me, gave a ſudden skreek; the poor Woman, who was a common Harlot, that was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Straw, ſuppoſing it to be her Boy, my Mother having a little before given her ſome of my old Clothes, laid her hand upon the Stones, and leapt directly into the Well, which was up to her Breaſt in Water, and catching me in her Arms handed me out, with very little diſcovery of Life in me. This amazing Providence had not the leaſt effect upon me to frighten me out of my Sins; but being well recovered, I became more ſinful than before; and that which tended to heighten it, was that I made this Harlot's Son, who had been the Inſtrument in ſaving me, my chief Companion. In this courſe I continued, until I was about thirteen years of Age. Being a dull Scholar, and my Maſter churliſh to me, and beating me about the Head, I was almoſt ſtupified; and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melancholy, I was judg'd to be gone into a Conſumption: My Mother adviſing with Dr. <hi>Korbat</hi> about me, he adviſed her to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34405:81"/>take me from the School, which ſhe did; but my Father, that I might not forget to read Engliſh well, borrowed for me <hi>Fox</hi>'s Acts and Monuments, which I began to take great delight in: And the firſt thing that faſtened upon my Heart to do me good, was a Letter of <hi>Bilnay</hi>'s to <hi>Dunſtal</hi> the Popiſh Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, wherein that holy Martyr laying before the Biſhop the manner of his Life, that he was a Maſs-Prieſt to pray Souls out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; <q>Reading, ſaith he, <hi>Tindal</hi>'s New Teſtament, at the laſt I came to hear of Jeſus: Which Paſſage was fixed upon my Heart as if it had been written upon it.</q> Leaving the Book, I went out, and began with great deliberation to conſider of this Paſſage, and the reaſon that ſhould make this holy Man and others give up their Lives with ſuch chearfulneſs in the Fire, whenas, by conforming to the Publick Worſhip, they might many of them have lived in great Proſperity.</p>
               <p>I begun to think of a future ſtate, and the manner of Life that I had led in the World, to the great diſhonour of that God that gave me my Being; my Sins were then ſet in order before me, and I began to be fill'd with ſuch inward Guilt and Fear, that I was many times afraid to be alone, yet never made my Condition known to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34405:82"/>any Perſon, but often bewailed it before God, and reſolved, which I was enabled through Mercy to perform, to turn my Back on my former vicious Company, and betook my ſelf to a very retired Life, even beyond the moſt young Men that I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, not daring to allow my ſelf the Pleaſures of youthful Vanities. My Mother being a Hearer of Mr. <hi>Luck,</hi> I frequently went with her, and was much affected with his preaching; but two things fell out which wholly alienated my Mind from him, and indeed almoſt from all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Miniſters, for his ſake.</p>
               <p>The Act againſt ſeditious Conventicles coming forth, forbidding all Perſons above four beſides the Miniſter to aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under pretence of the Worſhip of God; after Mr. <hi>Luck</hi> had finiſhed his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe on the Lord's-day before the Act took place, two Rooms being full of Hearers, he ſtood up and acquainted them with the Act, and that he could no longer preach to above four, as the Act directed. A ſecond thing that gave me the greateſt Offence was, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my Mother to hear him after the Act was in force, four Perſons were gotten there before us, and the Door lock'd; we deſired to let be in, and were not willing to be denied, until we were refuſed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which cauſed me to break forth into
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34405:82"/>this or the like Expreſſion, That it could not be, that he was a Miniſter of the Goſpel, who was more afraid of Man than of God; and for my part I would never go to hear him more. That which heightned my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs to him, was my Father's frequent upbraiding of us with our careleſs Shepherd, who in time of danger was aſham'd to own his Flock. From that time I began to have a particular Eye upon the poor deſpiſed Quakers, whom I look'd upon as the only People God had in the World; for altho I had ſhaken off ſinful ſelf, I had not ſhaken off righteous ſelf; and by reading a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Books, I was more and more confirm'd in their Foundation-Principle, of the Light in every Man, which convinceth him of Sin, being the Light of Chriſt, which, from an experienced Heart I have cauſe to ſpeak it, is no other but the Light of the firſt Covenant, that ſhews Man his ſtate and condition he is in by Sin, but leads not into the Goſpel-Diſpenſation: but as the Light, according to the tenor of the firſt Covenant, calls for an Obedience to the Law, ſo by keeping up to a ſtrict walking according to its requirings, much inward Peace is gain'd; and this I very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that having through Temptations outwardly, and from Corruption inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been led into Sin, this Light, which is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34405:83"/>God's Witneſs in the Souls of all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> did begin to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, and I felt inward Guilt, and fear of Puniſhment ariſing in my Breaſt, which made me look for ſome trouble or other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling me for running in the way of Sin, and very ſeldom miſs'd of it; which Trouble was an inſtrumental means to drive me to my Knees to bewail my Condition before God, and frequently with great earneſtneſs of Heart have beſought him that I might come to a ſinleſs ſtate, never to go aſtray from him: but to witneſs a being led out to behold the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Redeemer, or as Mediator betwixt God and Man, from any inward Work of God upon my Heart, I did not in the leaſt experience; altho I do believe all that knew my Converſation will ſay that it was very ſtrict, yet under the leadings of this firſt Covenant-Principle. And mark it, my Children, this I leave with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as one that, to the praiſe of rich Grace be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, hath found Mercy at the hand of God) that it is not your joining with the pureſt Truths of Chriſtianity that ought to be the Evidence to your ſelves of your being ſuch as God will own for Chriſtians, but it is the Principle by which your Hearts are guided in the Worſhip of Chriſt, whether private or publick, that muſt be the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34405:83"/>A Chriſtian that is brought to walk with God by the Spirit of Adoption, is taken off the old Foundation and ſet upon a new Foundation; his hope of enjoying eternal Life is fixt upon his Union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, through whom eternal Happineſs is ſecured unto him in ſuch a way as is impoſſible it ſhould miſcarry. But this I ſhall ſpeak to by and by, when I come to ſhew you how my Soul cloſed with the Lord Jeſus, and return to ſpeak a little further of that poor deſpiſed People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who I did believe were in the Favour of God above any People in the World: and altho I did not join with them ſo far as publickly to meet with them at their Worſhip, yet I gave frequent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies how highly I eſteemed them. The Perſecution upon the account of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences increaſing, about the year Eighty three, I did endeavour to ſhelter them what in me lay, by perſwading the Towns Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to endeavour to baffle the Informers; and being choſen an Overſeer of the Poor at that time, and ſo being injoyn'd by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to take their Goods, I was driven into grievous Perplexity, not knowing which way to turn me; for I was grievouſly afraid of the Juſtices on the one hand, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averſe to ſuch an Act on the other hand, believing them to be God's People, which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34405:84"/>cauſed me to ſhed a great many Tears in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret before God for Counſel and Direction: and bleſſed be his holy Name he did not leave me, but open'd a way for my Eſcape, which Mercy I deſire to keep in remembrance while I am in this World. The night before the Warrant was to be executed, I was very ſick all the night, but in the morning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better; the Officers meeting together about that wicked Work, to which they were all averſe, ſent for me, but my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of not being well would not ſerve their turn, but they proceeded by Lot to take the Houſes of that poor People, and ſent me my Lots, which I received with a great deal of joy; ſeeing they deſired me either to ſend Mony, or get one to officiate. I ſent them the Mony rejoicing, and upon my Knees bleſſed God for that great Mercy: and tho the poor Quakers did offer me my Mony again, yet I durſt not for Conſcience ſake receive it. I leave this with you as my Judgment, that a miſguided Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to be informed, not forced; God hath appointed other ways in his Word to reclaim thoſe that are in an Error, than by ruining Mens Perſons and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>The Liberty for Diſſenters being granted by King <hi>James,</hi> I was brought to hear five or ſix diſſenting Miniſters at <hi>Richard Cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>'s, which through the Bleſſing of God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34405:84"/>ſo far wrought upon me, as to take off that Prejudice that I had conceived againſt them; but my Underſtanding remained dark without any inward diſcovery of the precious Doctrine of the Goſpel, until I ſat under the Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>Humphreys,</hi> being before that time a high Aſſerter of Free-will and general Redemption, which naturally falls under the firſt Covenant-Principle. His Perſonal Failings, which brought a ſtain upon the precious Truths f the Goſpel, through Mercy I abhorr'd, and took the freedom at times to ſpeak to him about it; yet his Doctrine which he preached was the inſtrumental means to bring me and many other poor Sinners to join with the Truth, which through Mercy I was inabled to do upon the account of its own Worth and Excellency. And mark it, my Children, that which muſt eſtabliſh your Hearts in the Truths of God, muſt be the holy Spirit's inlightening your Souls to behold the Truth in the Scripture-Glaſs, and inabling your Souls to ſee a native Beauty and Excellency in it, above any Luſtre that the Creature can put upon it by any Rhetorical Floriſhes whatſoever. I cannot ſee what ſolid ground Perſons can have to lay claim to an Intereſt in the Foundation-Truths of Chriſtianity, before the charming Simplicity that doth appear
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34405:85"/>in Truth doth allure and win upon the Heart to lay hold of it. When the holy Spirit doth preſent Truth unto the Soul, it puts ſuch a Divine Authority into it, as conſtrains the Soul to bow before it, and to ſubmit unto it.</p>
               <p>That Scripture which the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed to make uſe of to preſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto my Soul, and to ſeal unto it an Intereſt in God as my God through him, was the words of Chriſt to <hi>Mary,</hi> Joh. 20. the latter part of the 17th Verſe, <hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</hi> In which words the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was preſented unto my Soul, as the Perſon by whom we are brought into rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God; and so was I inabled to lay hold of him with my whole Heart as the Perſon that opens the door of Grace and Mercy; and under the inward ſenſe and feeling of that Grace and Mercy which I did then receive from my heavenly Father, as an Evidence of his accepting of me through his Son, my Heart was exceedingly melted before him, and drawn forth by the Spirit of Adoption into ſuch a familiarity with him as to lay open my Heart before him, being not then afraid to let him know the worſt of my Condition, from that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I had in that bleſſed Mediator
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34405:85"/>that ſtood betwixt us. I then experienced a new Principle begotten in my Soul, which knit my Heart to the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus; I felt my Heart leaning towards him for Security and Safety: and while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evidence of my Union with him did laſt, I look'd upon my ſelf to be without the reach of the Tempter; and altho many Clouds and Temptations have been upon me ſince the time of my firſt cloſing with him, yet he hath not ſuffered me to be overwhelmed by them, but in the midſt of Troubles hath diſcovered himſelf unto me. And this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I have experienced, that when ſome ſudden ſurprizing Providence hath fallen upon me, that ſeem'd to be of a frowning nature, my Soul being rouz'd, did ſhake it ſelf to ſee if it's ſpiritual Strength remained. Its firſt ſearch hath been after its Union with its Lord, and to get the Heart raiſed to God through him. If Grace remained ſo as to keep the Heart knit unto Chriſt, to wreſtle with the Father through him, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſlaviſh Fear fled away, and a ſubmiſſive frame of Spirit took place of it, to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by God according to his Wiſdom; and before the Trouble was wholly over, ſome comfortable Scripture was born in as an earneſt that the Deliverance was coming. My hope for Heaven lies in this, that I am in the way that all the Flock have walk'd in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34405:86"/>unto this day. For the New Teſtament ſtands upon the Credit and Authority of the Old: If the Meſſiah were yet to come to work out Man's Salvation, the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Prophecies concerning him could have their Accompliſhment in no other way than they are laid down fulfilled in the New, in the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of Sins.</hi> And beſides this, my Heart hath been inwardly made ſenſible of the preventing Grace of God put forth outwardly towards me, and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning and renewing Grace hath been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted inwardly in me. Firſt, His preventing Grace hath been put forth outwardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, in that tender Watchfulneſs that my Heavenly Father hath ſhewed towards me to this day. How many times have I been in danger of being led away by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Temptations, and have been without the ſenſe of the danger that I was in, and yet ſomething hath fallen out that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my falling by the Temptation; and afterwards I have been made ſenſible of the Danger and of the Mercy received? This was a great means of ſettling my Soul in the Doctrine of Election; for I was many times conſtrained to cry out, Why doſt thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſuch Grace unto me a worthleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34405:86"/>For, my Children, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as ſtanding under the firſt Covenant I was a Sinner before God, and liable to his Juſtice: His condemning of me could have been no Injuſtice in him, therefore his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me in Mercy's way muſt lead me to acknowledg that it is by Grace I ſtand. Secondly, His pardoning and renewing Grace hath been manifeſted inwardly in me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Pardoning Grace hath been manifeſt in me; I have many times come before God labouring under inward Guilt, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a removal of the Guilt in the Goſpel way. For altho the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did by his Death give a full Satisfaction to Juſtice for all the Elect that were given him of the Father; yet while the Elect are on this ſide Eternity, and through frailty lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fall into Sin; after Sin committed there can be no inward Peace enjoy'd until the Soul be led forth anew by a Renewed Act of Faith upon a ſuffering Jeſus, and a ſuing by ſincere Repentance unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for pardoning Grace upon the account of his Worthineſs. And as to the Praiſe of the rich Grace of God I have experienced his pardoning Grace, ſo I hope, to the Praiſe of the ſame Grace I can ſay it, that I do experience Renewing Grace: I do indeed feel my time to be a continual Warfare according to the words of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34405:87"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh; and theſe are contrary one to the other; ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> Grace is often foiling Corruption, but hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd it; the growth of it is hindered, but the Seeds of it remain; it's an Enemy that lies continually lurking to watch for Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and altho it cannot regain ſuch a Power as to deſtroy my Soul, yet it keeps ſo much Power as to diſturb it. My Soul ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goes mourning before God under the ſenſe of the remaining ſtrength of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and how hardly is Grace put to it to quit the Soul out of its hands? But here lies my Security, I am brought within the compaſs of the Father's unchangeable Love, within the compaſs of the Sons In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and under the Leadings of the Holy Ghoſt. Firſt, I am within the compaſs of the Father's Love, being one of the Seed given to Chriſt; and according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Covenant do I experience the Father's dealings with me; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>If his Children</hi> (that is, the Elect Seed given to Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 28.) <hi>walk not in my Judgments; If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments: Then will I viſit their Tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their Iniquities with Stripes. Nevertheleſs, my Loving-kindneſs will I not utterly take from him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34405:87"/>nor ſuffer my Faithfulneſs to fail. My Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will I not break.</hi> Here is my Mercy, that I do experience my Father's dealing with me to be according to the Tenor of the Covenant, that his Providence towards me brings Frowns with it againſt Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he hath enlightned my Soul to ſee it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy Law.</hi> Frowning Providences are not of themſelves Mercies; but the Spirit's accompanying them, and working by them upon the Soul, to bring the Soul to a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of its State, and enabling, the Soul to ſeek to God and to enjoy Comfort from him through Faith, when denied Comfort from the World. It's this that gives the Evidence that they are ſent in Mercy, when corrupt Nature is ſubdued by them, and inward Grace is ſtirr'd up to put forth the greater Fervency to God, and for God, in Duty, that we may be ſerviceable to him in our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8. lays this down as the common way of God's dealing with his Children, and fixes Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy upon thoſe that are not thus dealt with: <hi>But if ye be without Chaſtiſement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of all are partakers, then are you Baſtards and not Sons.</hi> Mark it, my Children, I do not ſay God doth not give Proſperity to none of his Children in this World; but where
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34405:88"/>he doth give it, he uſually brings humbling Providences before it, that ſo the Soul may not be prejudiced by it. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were both exalted to a very high ſtate in this World; but what great Afflictions did they go through before they were brought to it? according to the words of the Prophet; <hi>It is good for a Man that he hear the Yoke in his Youth.</hi> And it hath been my particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, That where great plenty of this World's Goods are given to any of God's Children, they have had a pricking Thorn put into ſome of their outward Enjoyments, that they might not reſt in theſe things as their Portion.</p>
               <p>Secondly; I am one of thoſe for whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is interceding, and intereſted in him as a Member of his Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body: <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>keep through thine own Name thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one as we are.</hi> He intercedes that we may be prepared for Glory, and that we may be brought to the enjoyment of Glory: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my Glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> 
                  <q>This Prayer, ſaith a holy Man, altho it was pray'd here on Earth by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the ſtate of his Humiliation, yet the Matter contain'd in it doth ſute his State of Exaltation, and is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34405:88"/>a ſhort Epitome of his Interceſſion, as the Church's Head, now at the Right-hand of his Father, until every Member of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body be brought to the Manſions of eternal Reſt.</q> The Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. from <hi>v.</hi> 13 to 20. having laid down the Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Immutability of the Father's Council concerning the Elect, and how for their Encouragement he had bound himſelf not only by Word but by Oath, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the things contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and having ſhewed how the Flock do anchor upon their Father's Immutability as that which is both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and enters into that within the Vail; Faith doth not content it ſelf only with the Promiſes, but pierceth into Heaven to God himſelf; and the Soul there for its further Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beholds the bleſſed Mediator interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on its behalf, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Where the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is for us entred, even Jeſus.</hi> All the Promiſes of God the Father being made to our Nature firſt as it is united to his Son the Eternal Word; our Nature in him being brought to the Enjoyment of that Glory contained in the Promiſes, doth on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Elect intercede that every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſon that belongs unto him, may be brought to be ſharers with him. Your Father through Faith hath a well-grounded hope that he is one of the number for whom
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34405:89"/>his bleſſed Lord is interceding, and doubts not but in a little time to be a ſharer in that part of his Interceſſion which leads to enjoy eternal Glory through him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; I am one of thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leadings of the Spirit of Adoption, which is that inward Witneſs which the Scripture ſpeaks of: <hi>He that believeth in the Son of God hath the Witneſs in himſelf: For God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the knowledg of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. That is, The way that God doth take to exalt his Grace and Mercy to his Elect, is in a way that doth agree with his Juſtice. He beholds the eternal Word <hi>Creator</hi> united to the Childrens Nature, by it giving Satisfaction to Juſtice. The ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Grace being removed, Grace doth ſhine down upon them. The Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the inward Witneſs, meets Grace in the way that it comes forth. The Soul admires the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in appointing the way of its Salvation in ſuch a way as exalts Grace, and wrongs not Juſtice; Grace being no leſs to us by making its way through Chriſt to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the Father that appointed the Son this Work; and it was to anſwer the Father's Will that he performed it. This
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34405:89"/>inward Witneſs incourageth a poor Sinner that is weary of Sin to go to Chriſt, and to God through him. For altho there ſeems a great diſtance betwixt a poor guilty Sinner and a holy God, to behold each of them as they are in themſelves, yet this middle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler, or the maker up of the Breach betwixt them, being inwardly diſcovered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Glaſs by the Holy Ghoſt working with it; thoſe who were far off before are brought nigh by the Blood of this bleſſed Jeſus. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love deſcends, Faith enables the Soul to mount up, and with Wings to aſcend. <hi>We love him,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Light of the Holy Ghoſt is a diſtinct thing from the firſt Covenant-Principle. That lays the Soul under Guilt for Sin, but takes not in the way of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: The Holy Ghoſt takes in the way of Reconciliation, and gives Evidence of the Souls Intereſt in it. It is by the Apoſtle called the Spirit of the Son, becauſe it is by the Interceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that the Holy Ghoſt is ſent; and becauſe it leads the Soul to pay the Tribute of Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, as being the way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It leads the Soul wholly in another way than the firſt Covenant-Principle leads in. Its Motives by which it ſtirs up the Soul to watch againſt Sin are from Mercy and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34405:90"/>Goodneſs, that is, ſpiritual Mercies received by the Soul. The firſt Covenant-Principle breaks the Soul off from Sin, by ſhewing the Wrath and Miſery that attends it: The Holy Ghoſt ſtirs up the Soul to ſet a Watch againſt the firſt motions of Luſt, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the loathſom nature of it; which if the Soul joins with it, will thereby be unfit for Communion with God. As it is by the Holy Ghoſt that Sanctification is carried or. in the Soul to prepare it for the Enjoyment of God in Glory, ſo the Apoſtle ſeems to put the Cure of the Bodies of the Saints, even when they are under a Diſſolution, upon the Holy Ghoſt, in order to their recovery out of that ſtate; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> I have gone through the firſt Head, and laid before you the dealings of God with me, in bringing of me to the Enjoyment of himſelf by Faith, and ſhall now proceed to the ſecond Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> The Counſel and Direction which I recommend unto you, if I ſhould be ſhortly removed from you.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Endeavour to get imprinted upon your Hearts the thoughts of God in his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over you, and thoſe outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34405:90"/>which he exerciſeth towards you. God is ſo incomprehenſible in his Being, that he cannot be fathom'd by the Creature. What an Awe and Reverence of him hath the Conſideration of his Incomprehenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made upon the Hearts of his deareſt Children? In his diſcovering of himſelf to them in the greatneſs of his Power, how hath he treated them as Worms and nothing Creatures? And they in their expreſſing of themſelves before him; their Language hath carried in it the Evidences of a humble Heart: Pſal. 22.4, 5, 6. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee: they truſted and thou didſt deliver them. They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they truſted in thee, and were not confounded. But I am a Worm, and no Man; a reproach of Men, and deſpiſed of the People.</hi> We ſee here the Pſalmiſt David, who is recorded to be a Man after God's owh Heart, how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf before God: Firſt, In ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging God in his Power to deliver: And then, ſecondly, In acknowledging his Unworthineſs to be delivered by him, in theſe words, <hi>I am a Worm, and no Man.</hi> The clearer Diſcovery that the Soul gets of God in the Abſoluteneſs of his Power, and that incomprehenſible Greatneſs he is inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal, hath that Effect upon the Heart as to lay it in the Duſt before him. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, my Children, that in your Creation
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34405:91"/>you were in the hands of the wiſe Creator, as the Clay is in the hand of the Potter; The forming and the faſhioning of you lay wholly in his own Will and Pleaſure: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.73. <hi>Thy hands have made and faſhioned me: give me <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that I may learn thy Commandments.</hi> That there is no defect in the Members of your Bodies is a Mercy to you; but that there is no defect in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of your Souls is a greater Mercy. What great Obligations are you under to the great Creator, ſeeing you have received your Being from him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how the Creator has diſpoſed of you, and how his Providential Dealings are towards you; <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. <hi>And hath made of one Blood, all Nations of Men, to dwell on the face of the Earth, and hath determined the Times afore appointed, and the Bounds of their Habitation.</hi> That is, He hath determined the time that he allows every one in this World, and their place for a Habitation in it. How bountiful is the great Creator un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that he ſhould appoint you your place in <hi>England,</hi> and not in <hi>India,</hi> or ſome other dark place of the World, that is full of the Habitations of Cruelty! that your Lot ſhould be hitherto, to have a full ſupply of outward Neceſſaries, whereas many others are attended by great outward Wants and Penury.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:34405:91"/>
3. Conſider God's Providential Dealings towards you; that your Parents have been hitherto continued, and made a Bleſſing to you, that they have not been wanting to your outward Man by their utmoſt care to provide for it: But above all, what a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing have they been made unto you as to your Souls, if it be but ſanctified unto you? What proof have your poor Parents given of their Care over your Souls, in giving you your Education in ſuch a way as hath been a means to bring them under great outward Straits, their Eyes being fixt upon the good of your immortal Souls in what they have done, that you might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Temptations that attend a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of profane Children? If under all theſe Mercies your Hearts remain hard and inſenſible, it's a full Proof that you are in an unconverted State.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider what Duties your Creator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of you, and the Penalty annexed, where there is a failure of it. As the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath put the World and what is in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all the Creatures might be made ſerviceable unto him; ſo hath he put Man under a Law, and hath annexed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Penalty unto it, that ſo Man might know that he does owe a Subjection to his Creator, who hath an abſolute Soveraignty over him to diſpoſe of him as he pleaſeth.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34405:92"/>It was the Creator's Pleaſure to put Man under a Law, and endue him with a Light that led to the Obedience of it, that ſo the great Creator in his proceeding with Man in a way of Puniſhment, for the breach of that Law which he put him under, might, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be juſt and righteous, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou haſt deſtroyd thy ſelf, but in me is thine help.</hi> That God doth not proceed in a way of Juſtice againſt all the fallen Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> who are as a polluted Lump before him, proceeds from his condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goodneſs; and that he doth lead ſome into the ſtate of Children, while the great multitude are left to be dealt with in a way of Juſtice, as ſtanding under the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is the good pleaſure of his Will. As he is not the Author of Sin; ſo in dealing with Sinners, he may either inflict Puniſhment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Covenant, or he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Mercy in Mercy's way. Have you a care, while you think with Free-willers to vindicate the equitable Right which all Men have in God as their Creator, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench not upon his Soveraignty. That God as a Soveraign Being doth beſtow outward and inward Mercies according to his own Pleaſure, is evident to the very reaſon of thoſe that partake of each of theſe Mercies; and yet that doth not exclude Man's Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the getting the former, neither
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34405:92"/>Chriſtian Duties as the way which we are led to receive the latter. That Heathen King <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> when he was brought down from his Seat of Pride, did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God's Soveraignty, and his right of diſpoſing of all theſe outward things to whom he pleaſeth. Dan. 4.35. <hi>And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> As he hath the ſole right in diſpoſing of Kingdoms, in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down one and raiſing up another; ſo likewiſe in leſſer things his right of diſpoſal of all things doth daily manifeſt it ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.11. <hi>I returned, and ſaw under the Sun, that the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong, neither yet Bread to the Wiſe, nor yet Riches to Men of underſtanding, nor yet Favour to Men of skill, but time and chance happeneth unto all.</hi> God's right of diſpoſal is no bar to your providential Care how to live in the World, and making uſe of means that his wiſe Providence doth hand out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: But yet you muſt know that God doth reſerve in his own hands the Power to check the Endeavours of the Creature as often as he pleaſeth, that ſo his Soveraign Right may be kept up amongſt them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34405:93"/>God's Soveraign Right in diſpoſing of ſpiritual Mercies, is likewiſe evident to thoſe who are made Partakers of them. Rom. 3.9. <hi>What then? are we better than they? No in no wiſe: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin.</hi> That is, in reſpect of their State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as ſtanding under the firſt Covenant, they were liable to be dealt with in a way of Juſtice, as well as others. And this meets the Experience of every ſincere Chriſtian: The Sentence of the Law is laid open before them, and the Juſtice of the Law to them-wards is preſented unto them. So that all Pleas that the Soul can make upon the terms of the firſt Covenant are wholly ſilenced; and the only Plea left is the Plea of the Prodigal, <hi>Lord, be merciful unto me a Sinner.</hi> But mark it, ray Children, the Scripture doth not expreſs the Procedure of the General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be according to the Decrees of God, but according to Man's Obedience to that meaſure of Light that he receives from God, and his neglect of Duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its requirings. And yet I am fully ſatisfied that the Salvation of the Elect will appear then more clearly to be of Grace than now it doth, that Heaven may indeed be a Life of Praiſe. Mark it, my Children, the Scripture doth with great plainneſs ſhew the ſtate of thoſe that are ſtanding under
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34405:93"/>the Law; the Laws Threatnings againſt them: it doth likewiſe with, great plainneſs ſhew the ſtate of thoſe that are really in the Covenant of Grace, and the Privileges that ſuch Perſons are made partakers of that are in this well-ordered Covenant: Now your great Work is to bring your Hearts to the Glaſs of the Law, and to the Glaſs of the Goſpel, that ſo you may find your State and Condition; whether your Hearts move to Godward, according to the Light of the firſt Covenant; or that you receive Light and Life from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of Righteouſneſs. Is that Virtue drawn down from him by Faith that gives motion to Duty? Is it through him that Communion with the Father is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd? Is it through him that Communion with the Father is continued? Communion with the Father depends upon Union with the Son, as Mediator, the way to the Father: this you will experience by bringing your Hearts to the Glaſs of the Goſpel, if you be in the Covenant of Grace. The Scripture ſhews, that in God's bringing the Heart over to himſelf, by Light, firſt received, he calls to believe in Chriſt, and then to a ſincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Duty from Goſpel-Light, the means to lead to the Enjoyment of Chriſt, and through him to God, as our God: the Heart ſubjected to God as our God, engaged to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34405:94"/>him by Faith, and ſincerely following him, the Evidence of our Intereſt in him. But if you ſtick in the Birth, and are aſhamed to follow the Light by a ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe of the Reproach that doth attend the good Ways of God, you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make it appear, that you prefer Man before God; and altho the Light you have receivd may tend to quiet Conſcience at preſent, it will but tend to heighten and aggravate your Miſery in Eternity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Endeavour to get imprinted upon your Hearts the remembrance of Death and Eternity, the certainty of it, and the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs of it to many. When you ſee Death ſurprizingly ſtealing upon Perſons of your Age, let it be as a warning to you to ſearch into your fitneſs for it; remember there is no Work nor Device in the Grave: If out of Chriſt, when Death comes to you, then miſerable for ever; if in Chriſt when Death comes, happy for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take care to get your Judgments throughly informd, and ſettled in the Foundation-Principle of Chriſtianity: <hi>Other Foundation can no Man lay than that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> an all-ſufficient Saviour. Remember you muſt always go empty to him, but have a care of returning empty from him. Have the Saints in all Ages beheld ſuch an Excellency in him, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34405:94"/>can you ſee none? It's a ſign your Hearts are not right with him; you talk of what you do not enjoy. <hi>To you that believe,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>he is precious:</hi> it's ſuch a Faith as gives a view of his Perſon in the Goſpel-Glaſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Endeavour to be much in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward experimental, part of Religion. Have a care of ſticking in the true Form without the Power; and have a care of a pretended Power without the true Form. If you ſtick in the pureſt Form without the Power, you get no further than Formaliſts, and are no better than a lifeleſs Image without Motion in God's account: For Revealed Religion was appointed to bring the Heart to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; and where this is not attained, the great Deſign of God in giving forth Revealed Religion is loſt. Have a care of a pretended Power without the true Form; for by this you will be laid open to the Transformings of Satan, and to his Deceivings as an Angel of Light. Lend not an Ear to that Spirit that gets above the holy Scriptures as a Rule and Guide. How many Perſons who have ſeemd to be in a hopeful way in the Truths of Chriſtianity, have been led into By-paths through Satan's Wiles? and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſincere Chriſtians have ſo far fallen as to loſe much of their former Experiences.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If the Lord in Mercy to you make you

Beſides, your Mercy will be very great in having the watchful Eye of ſincere Chriſtians over you, to incourage you in your Chriſtian Courſe, and to be faithful Reprovers of you, if they ſee that you do not walk orderly, according to the Rule of the Goſpel. This is one of the great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that attend thoſe that are in Church-fellowſhip; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch an one in the Spirit of Meekneſs; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted. Two</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>are better than one, becauſe they have a good Reward for their Labour; for if they fall, the one will lift up his Fellow; but wo to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him.</hi> If two Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be ſerviceable one to another, how much more to have a conſiderable number of ſincere Chriſtians watching over you?</p>

9. Endeavour to get imprinted upon your Hearts, that the Life of a Chriſtian while he is paſſing through this World, is a Life of Prayer. When God takes Perſons into Covenant with him, he pours out upon their Souls the Spirit of Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Prayer is the Intelligencer betwixt the Saints here on Earth, and their Father now in Heaven; it is that which keeps God's Ear open to us, and our Hearts open for him. The bleſſed Jeſus, ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, the effect it had upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to bring them to a ſincere Repentance, and by ſtrong Cries to lay open their ſtate before God, he tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12. <hi>And from the days of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt until now, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by force.</hi> He compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth theſe poor returning Penitents, to a Company of Souldiers drawn up in Battel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array, to force their Entrance into a Fort or Caſtle; their Cries here on Earth piercing into Heaven. Prayer made God uſe that familiar and condeſcending Expreſſion to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 32.9, 10, 11. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>I have ſeen this People, and behold, it is a ſtiff-necked People. Now therefore let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them: and I will make of thee a great Nation. And</hi> Moſes <hi>beſought the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34405:96"/>Lord his God, and ſaid, Why doth thy Wrath wax hot againſt thy People, which thou haſt brought forth out of the Land of</hi> Egypt? You may ſee in theſe and the following words to the 15th Verſe, what prevalency Prayer hath upon God when it is put up on the behalf of others, much more when it is on our own behalf.</p>
               <p>In treating of this Subject, I ſhall,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Shew what Prayer is, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the neceſſity of the continuance of it, while we are on this ſide Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> I ſhall ſhew what Prayer is, and the nature of it. We may take Prayer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, under a twofold Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Firſt, As proceeding from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage. And here the Heart doth not cry unto God from an inward ſight and feeling that it is intereſted in God, but by the light of the firſt Govenant: It looks upon God as Creator, and as having an Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in him to ſupply Nature's Wants, and to deliver from approaching Miſery: This Prayer is Nature's Cry, and is oftentimes put forth with a great deal of Earneſtneſs, where there is no Evidence of an Intereſt in God, or Communion with God. But that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34405:96"/>Prayer which. I deſign to lay open, is the Work of the Spirit of Adoption upon the Hearts of the Saints; and this conſiſts in theſe three parts: 1ſt. In giving inward Light to ſee the things neceſſary to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. <hi>2dly.</hi> In giving Life and Motion to the Faculties of the Soul, that ſo the Soul may be engag'd in the Duty. <hi>3dly.</hi> In leading the Soul in the way by which an Entrance is obtained into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhew the nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightnings of the Spirit in the Duty of Prayer, how they are diſcovered in the Soul of Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Inlightnings of the Spirit are diſcovered in the Soul of Man by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inward Frame that the Soul is in. The Hearts of the unconverted World are always in an ill Frame; and that which is their great Miſery, they want Light to ſee it: but if the Saints be in an ill frame, they are in Mercy brought to ſee it, remaining Corruption is diſcovered; deadneſs, and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wandering of the Heart from God is diſcovered; the holy Spirit gives Light that the Heart may be rectified and made fit for Communion with God, becauſe therein lies Man's chief Happineſs. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The things that concern the outward Man are through the Inlightnings of the holy Spirit beheld as of leſs Concern
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34405:97"/>and Worth, altho they do lie next to Senſe; and the Hearts of the Saints have been ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to get above them, and to part with them, when they ſtood in Competition with the ſincere performance of thoſe Duties which God call'd them to. The Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spirit doth concern it ſelf for the outward Man, but it is that Nature may be ſatisfied, and not Luſt gratified; it is that ſuch a Supply may be given, as Nature may be kept from Temptations, not that we may run into Temptations. <hi>Remove far from me Vanity and Lies; give me neither Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty nor Riches; feed me with Food conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me; leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the Name of my God in vain.</hi> While the Heart is without the Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Spirit, it is made a Servant to thoſe things that are moſt obvious to Senſe. Daily Experience ſhews us, that the Heart of every unconverted Sinner doth place its Satisfaction in the enjoyment of theſe things, altho they end in Death: ſo that the Inlightnings of the holy Spirit are abſolutely neceſſary in the Duty of Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Spirit gives inward Life and Motion to the Faculties of the Soul, that ſo the Soul may be ingag'd in the Duty; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34405:97"/>what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> That is, the Spirit follows the Inlightnings with inward Life and Motion, by which the Heart is ſet a working after God, for the removal of that which ſtands in the way of Communion with him; and for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, there is an inward ſenſibility doth accompany the Matter which we preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Duty; not only the things we pray for are preſented unto God as thoſe we have need of, but the Heart goes along with them, that our Heavenly Father may ſee we are in earneſt with him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my Soul.</hi> Compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. <hi>My Soul break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the longings that it hath to thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all times.</hi> The holy Spirit draws out the Heart with ſuch earneſtneſs unto God, as if there were a Separation going to be made betwixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Soul and the Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The holy Spirit doth lead the Soul in the way by which Entrance is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd into Heaven. We muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Spirit's Interceſſion in us, and the Son's Interceſſion for us. The Spirit's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in us, is that ſupplicating, begging frame which the holy Spirit doth inable the Soul to expreſs it ſelf in, when it appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: yet this through the weakneſs of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34405:98"/>the Creature, is attended with a great deal of Imperfection. But the Interceſſion of the Son for us, as Mediator, the Church's Head, is that upon which our admittance into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is granted. His Prayer is a perfect Prayer, and carries Incenſe along with it to perfume ours: <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a Golden Cenſer; and there was given him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the Prayers of all Saints, upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne.</hi> This Angel is the Angel of the Covenant, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the Church's Head; the Cenſer is his holy glorified Body, the Man Chriſt; the Incenſe is his Divine Nature, the Perfume of which perfuming the Supplications, or Prayers of the Saints, and aſcending with them before God, gains acceptance. That Spirit that would aſſume a right of giving Salvation by Man's Obedience to it, its Work is as oppoſite to the leadings of the Holy Ghoſt as Light and Darkneſs. For as the Declaration of the Goſpel leads to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as God-Man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, our Emanuel, as Redeemer, and as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, who is able to ſave all thoſe that come to God by him; ſo with this doth the Holy Ghoſt agree in his inward Witneſs in the Souls of the Saints: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34405:98"/>you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy of me. And ye alſo ſhall bear witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have been with me from the beginning.</hi> This is that new and living way which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, which gives Boldneſs in our approaching before God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Having therefore, Brethren, boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt by the Blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us, through the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh.</hi> The <hi>Holieſt,</hi> that is, into Heaven, of which the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> under the Law was a Type; <hi>by a living way,</hi> that enlivens the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that walks in it, <hi>boldneſs,</hi> or a holy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being given to plead with God, which yet cauſeth great Humility in the Soul, its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God being grounded upon the account of another's Worthineſs (which by Faith the Soul is inabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) and not upon the account of its own Worthineſs. This is the Way that meets the Experience of the Saints that are now upon the Earth; this is the Way that the Flock walk'd in who are gone to Heaven before us; we may ſay we are compaſſed about with a Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of this Head of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Prayer, is to ſhew the neceſſity of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34405:99"/>continuance of it while we are on this ſide Eternity.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe we have a multitude of Temptations attending of us outwardly.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>2dly.</hi> Becauſe the Soul doth too readily join with the Baits that gratify corrupt Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you that we have a multitude of Temptations attending of us outwardly. The World is gotten to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high pitch of Atheiſm and Profaneneſs; Chriſtianity, as to the Power of it, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed, but Perſons have loſt that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality that former Ages did enjoy. You can hardly deal in the World now but you are in danger every moment to be carried away with the Stream; the Difficulties of getting an outward Support for the Body being great, Satan takes the advantage of it to draw out the Corruptions of Mens Hearts after theſe things, ſo as to hurry them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their Endeavours to keep, and to gain a ſhare in this fading World without any Conſideration. Where is the Perſon that hath the Fear of the Almighty before him, and an inward Tenderneſs leſt he ſhould offend him? Did <hi>David</hi> take up this Complaint, <hi>Wo is me, that I ſojourn in</hi> Meſech, <hi>that I dwell in the Tenths of</hi> Kedar! <hi>My Soul
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34405:99"/>hath long dwelt with him that hateth Peace.</hi> What cauſe have we every day to take up the ſame Complaint, if we look upon the Immorality of the Times we live in? moſt Perſons being at Peace with the ways of Sin, but unwilling to be brought to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that Peace which the ways of Holineſs do afford. Surely, my Children, if God in Mercy to your Souls open your Underſtandings to ſee that great danger that your precious Souls are in, you will ſee a great neceſſity laid upon you to keep cloſe to God by the great Duty of Prayer, that you may ſtand in his Counſel, and that he may undertake to lead you in a ſafe way, that ſo you may be kept from the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the times you live in. If the Lord be ſo gracious to you, as by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to open a door for you, by which you may get daily Bread, in a way that doth not expoſe you to thoſe great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that many are expoſed to, tho it be in a lower ſtation in the World, make choice of it before Greatneſs in the World with Temptations. Conſider the wiſe Man's words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.22. <hi>He that haſteth to be rich, hath an evil Eye, and conſidereth not that Poverty ſhall come upon him.</hi> It's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that inſatiably drives him forward, and ſuffers him not to conſider how he is heaping Sin upon his Soul while he is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34405:100"/>together theſe worldly things. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho God do let ſuch Perſons live out their days with the Enjoyment of theſe outward things, yet what a heap of Guilt do ſuch Perſons carry with them into Eternity? Remember what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>For they that will be rich, fall into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Snare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in Deſtruction and Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another great thing that ſhews the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the continuance of the Duty of Prayer as long as we are on this ſide Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is, that till then Satan hath not his Power of tempting of us wholly taken from him. It is the great Mercy of God's Children, that the Rage of this devouring Lion is limited; that he has not liberty to execute all that Rage againſt them which is in him: But daily Experience ſhews us that the Father is pleaſed to give Satan ſo much Power againſt his Children, as to vex and grieve them with thoſe violent Temptations he at times ſuggeſts into them. Now the only way to eſcape this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and to be ſtrengthened againſt his Temptations, is to keep up Communion with God by Prayer; for ſo long as God is inwardly injoy'd he cannot enter. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians, Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 17. ſaith, <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:34405:100"/>He doth not mean that we ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the exerciſe of that Duty, but that we ſhould endeavour to have our Hearts always in a frame for it.</p>
               <p>But, ſecondly, The neceſſity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Duty of Prayer doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear while we are on this ſide Eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul doth readily too often join with the Baits that gratify corrupt Nature. The Body is yet unredeemed, and therefore deſires to be gratified in thoſe things that delight the outward Man: the Senſes are as Doors and Windows unto the Soul to let in thoſe outward Objects, which are as ſo many Baits and Snares to, draw away the Soul after them. There is no keeping the door of the Heart ſhut againſt theſe things, but as the Soul is led up by Faith to Objects of a higher nature; and the Duty of Prayer is one of the great means made uſe of by the Spirit to give the Soul a view of thoſe things that are of a more excellent nature than theſe earthly things are.</p>
               <p>Again, Endeavour to get imprinted upon your Minds the neceſſity of an even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed frame of Spirit under the various changes of God's Providence. You know what is paſt, but you know not what is before you; whether Proſperity or Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity be appointed for you: Have a care
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34405:101"/>that with the change of Providences there be not a change of your Hearts for the worſe: Doth not daily Experience ſhew us that changes of Providence to poot unconverted Sinners have this effect upon them? What a change hath a ſudden Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to a higher Condition in the World made upon many unconverted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? They have hardly known how to behave themſelves toward thoſe that were their Familiars while they were in a low Condition, much leſs how to carry themſelves toward God who advanced them in the World. This change from a low ſtate in the World to a higher, hath been a means greatly to eat out that Life and Power that hath been in God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when in a low Condition: What a Change did it make in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that in diſcourſing with his Brethren, he ſo far forgets himſelf, as to make uſe of the Courtly Oaths that were then in faſhion? <hi>By the Life of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>ye are Spies.</hi> Again, What an effect upon Perſons hath a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change of Providence had, when they have been ſurprizingly brought down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a low Condition in the World, while they have been in an unconverted ſtate, that they knew not the way to go to God that they might humble their Souls before him? Through the ſtrength of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34405:101"/>accompanied with their Corruptions, they have been ſo overwhelmed that they have broken out in unbecoming Expreſſions towards God, and in a deſperate manner have laid violent hands upon themſelves: yea, ſome of God's Children when they have been under dark Providences for want of a ſettled frame, have ſhew'd too much of a fretful impatient Spirit, and, like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> have been fill'd with Murmurings and Repinings. O, endeavour to learn the Apoſtle's Leſſon, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Not that I ſpeak in reſpect of want: for I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> That you may learn this Leſſon, take theſe following Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Endeavour to get your Minds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with the thoughts of God as to that abſolute Power which he hath over you, and all his Creatures; that to him belongs the right of diſpoſing of you, and the things that he hath for a time given you, even as pleaſeth him; that to you belongs a humble ſubmiſſive frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as you are his Creatures, much more if he have brought you into the ſtate of Children.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Endeavour to ſee if you cannot find ſome of God's rational Creatures, and ſome of his dear Children in one reſpect or other exerciſed with greater Difficulties
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34405:102"/>than you are: having found ſome under greater Straits than your ſelves, ſearch into your Hearts and Lives, and ſee if you can find any moving Cauſe there why he ſhould not deal with you as with thoſe that you behold in a worſe Condition, and ſo learn Submiſſion to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look into the Scripture-Glaſs, and there behold that the way God hath taken with his Children to burn up the droſs of Corruption, and to fit the Soul for himſelf, is by afflicting Providences: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.10. — <hi>I have choſen thee in the furnace of Affliction.</hi> And let this be a means for you to preſs after the ſame ſanctified uſe of it: when it hath anſwered the end for which it was brought upon you, the Providence will be changed, or you taken from under it home to your Father's Houſe.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> Endeavour to get imprinted upon your Minds the neceſſity of having your Zeal in the Worſhip of God regulated by the Word of God. It is good for to be zealouſly affected always in a good thing; mind that it be from the Inlightenings of the Spirit within you that you are led to behold the Truth in the Letter of the holy Scriptures; and that by comparing Scripture with Scripture you receive full ſatisfaction concerning the Truth you lay
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34405:102"/>hold upon. Let this go before, and then your Zeal in worſhipping of God by it, and in bearing a Teſtimony for it, follow after. How many Perſons are exceeding zealous for things which they practiſe in their Religious Worſhip, that they have no ground for from the holy Scriptures, and do place all their hope in this their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Zeal, not being brought in the leaſt to witneſs the dealings of God with their Hearts? What miſchievous work hath blind Zeal made in the Chriſtian World? All the Sufferings and Troubles that have befallen the Children of God in all Ages have come in by it: true Zeal deſires to deſtroy Error, and to ſave the Perſon that is carried away with it; falſe Zeal falls upon the Perſon, and endeavours to ruin the outward Man for the pretended Errors of the inward Man. Where Perſons are one with you in the Foundation, and do walk with God by Faith anſwerable to their diſcoveries of Truth, tho you ſhould differ from them in many other things, let your Moderation be ſhewn towards them. And for thoſe that may differ from you in the Publick Worſhip of God upon further diſcoveries of Light received, have you a care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning any ſuch of being guilty of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, before you are able from the Letter of the Scripture to lay open their Error.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34405:103"/>It is the Scripture laid down in the Letter that is the Rule, and not Mens Conſequences from it; Conſequences may be allowed to ſtrengthen the Rule, but muſt not be allowed to be added to it.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> Endeavour to get imprinted upon your Minds the neceſſity of a holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation before Men; this is that which keeps up the Credit of Religion in the World in deſpite of all its Adverſaries: The World knows how to deal with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion when they meet it in a looſe Profeſſor, but they know not what to ſay to it, nor how to deal with it, when they meet it in a ſincere ſelf-denying Chriſtian, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation pleads for the Reality that is in Truth, and gives a check to the Oppoſers of it. By a holy Converſation we vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Intereſt of the Son of God in the World, and do invite poor Sinners that are convinced of the Evil that is in Sin, to come and taſte of that pleaſant Fruit that the ways of Holineſs do afford to thoſe that walk in them. There is a great difference betwixt the ways of Sin and Holineſs; Sin, tho it affords a ſeeming Pleaſure in the committing of it, yet draws after it Guilt and Miſery; Holineſs, tho in the Acts of it we receive Reproach from the profane World, a train of inward Peace and Comfort doth follow it. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34405:103"/>of Words cannot be taking to any Perſon where the Converſation doth ſpeak a quite contrary Language: To be looſe in Converſation under a pure Profeſſion, is for a Man to contrive how he may make himſelf the miſerableſt of Perſons when he comes in Eternity. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the Goſpel, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>And an High-way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe: the way-faring Men, tho Fools, ſhall not err therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall be called the way of Holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it.</hi> Where par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace is inwardly received for all Sins, the Soul under the ſenſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, hath an inward hatred againſt the very nature of Sin begotten in it, and an inward yearning after Holineſs, as that which adds Strength and Vigor to the new Creature in the Souls of the Saints. Where there is inward Strength and Vigor in the Soul againſt that Corruption which hinders Communion, there will be a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs againſt thoſe things that tend to the diſhonouring of God by our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
